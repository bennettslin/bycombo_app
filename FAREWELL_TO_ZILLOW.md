Farewell to Zillow

I wanted to express my gratitude for all that Zillow has done for me, as well as to reflect on how my time here fits into my overall life's journey. I found that in order to explain some things, I needed to provide additional context. So there's a bit of backstory here, which makes all of this a little more self-indulgent than I'd originally planned. Sorry! I've labeled the various parts, so feel free to jump in anywhere.

The rock band part

I spent the first years of my adult life in the Bay Area, playing in a band with friends. We weren't big by any means, but people we didn't know would know who we were. I'd walk into a party and overhear, "Hey, that's the Yearlings singer." I thought this was the most amazing feeling ever, and I wanted more of it! For some reason… my friends didn't. So after years of going nowhere, I decided to strike out on my own. The plan was to spend five years making a demo so epic that it was guaranteed to get noticed.

It worked. The demo attracted some record labels. But they needed to see that I had a working band. And as I quickly found out, it's hard to get others to join when: they aren't your close friends; they didn't contribute to the demo themselves; and, the music is so complex that it's difficult to learn. I just couldn't keep a band together long enough, and the talks fizzled. (Fun fact: After Jagjaguwar gave up on us, they signed Bon Iver.)

The grad school part

Not knowing what else to do, I moved to New York and got an MA in music composition. I then decided to get a PhD in music theory. The choice was between FSU and UW. I was genuinely torn, but my girlfriend at the time was from Little Rock, and she had no desire to live in the South again. So… Seattle it was! (Chelsea and Stephens have confirmed that Little Rock is indeed part of the South. They have yet to confirm if Tallahassee is also part of the South.)

Unfortunately, my advisor retired as soon as I arrived at UW, and no one else specialized in the neo-Riemannian theory that I came to study. In fact, I later learned that it's a bit controversial among music theorists, and some of the other professors were openly indifferent to it.

The tech meetup part

With no chance of getting a PhD, I wrapped up my studies with just another MA. Being in Seattle, I couldn't help but hear about the startup scene. Still stinging from my missed opportunity with the record labels, I had an idea for a startup of my own: a band incubator to connect ambitious musicians. Hoping to find a technical cofounder, I attended tech meetups. But no one wanted to join my startup.

However, through these meetups, I heard about something called a coding bootcamp. It seemed too good to be true. I applied and was accepted into General Assembly's second cohort. One day, we took a field trip to a company called Zillow. The name sounded familiar. As I stepped into the office, I realized I'd been there before, for a tech meetup.

The Zillow part

We sat in the classroom on floor 29, as Josh Ritter answered our questions. Everyone there seemed so warm and friendly. I loved their energy and spirit. Admittedly, the free snacks and ocean view also won me over. I vowed then and there to work at Zillow. For the next few weeks after I applied, no hour passed when I wasn't preparing for the interview. I got the offer.

I was the first developer on a new team called Rentals Revenue. My manager, Mark Winham, had started a few weeks earlier. To tackle my imposter syndrome, I decided to spend the first half year getting better at coding by working late. In the meantime, I would figure out what the next several years would look like for me. I was still committed to my lifelong ambition of making it in a band, and there was no doubt I'd eventually come back to it. It was just a question of how and when.

My friends advised me to play local shows in my free time, but I knew this wasn't feasible. As a dishwasher, I could switch hats easily because it wasn't a job I cared about. Whereas, as a developer, I would still think about coding after work, and that wasn't a bad thing. It challenged and engaged me. But this also meant I wasn't in the right headspace to write songs.

I needed an artistic project that could align with my Zillow work. So I decided to create an audio webcomic for my epic demo. For the next five years, I would put in forty hours a week at Zillow, and then another forty hours on my project. I ended up logging more than 10,000 hours on this webcomic!

I did my best to keep our code up to date with the latest JavaScript tools, partly because I was motivated to do the same for my own project. (This is why we were one of the earliest teams to switch to React. There was no way I was going to use YUI on a personal project!) When E.K. Yancy joined,
