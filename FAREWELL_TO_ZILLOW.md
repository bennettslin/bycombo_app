Farewell, and please check out the Bobtail Yearlings

I wanted to personally reflect on my time here at Zillow, and to express gratitude for all that you, my team and my colleagues, have done for me. Since the path I took is kind of unusual, I provided some additional context to explain certain parts. So there's a bit of backstory here, which makes all of this a little more self-indulgent than I'd originally planned. Sorry! I've labeled the various parts, so feel free to jump in (or out) at any point.

The rock band part

I spent the first years of my adult life in the Bay Area, playing in a band with friends. We weren't big by any means, but people we didn't know would know who we were. I'd walk into a party and overhear, "Hey, that's the Yearlings singer." I thought this was the most amazing feeling ever, and I wanted more of it! For some reason… my friends didn't. So after years of going nowhere, I decided to strike out on my own. The plan was to spend five years making a demo so epic, it was guaranteed to get noticed.

It worked. The demo attracted some record labels. But they needed to see that I had a working band. And as I quickly found out, it's hard to get others to join when: they aren't your close friends; they didn't contribute to the demo themselves; and, the music is so complex that it's difficult to learn. I just couldn't keep a band together long enough, and the talks fizzled. (Fun fact: After Secretly Group gave up on us, they signed Bon Iver.)

The grad school part

Not knowing what else to do, I moved to New York and got an MA in music composition. Still not knowing what to do, I decided to get a PhD in music theory. The choice was between FSU and UW. I was torn between the two, but my girlfriend at the time, who was from Little Rock, had no desire to live in the South again. So she chose for us: Seattle it was! (Chelsea and Stephens, feel free to confirm if Tallahassee is really part of the South.)

Unfortunately, my advisor retired as soon as I arrived at UW, and no one else specialized in the neo-Riemannian theory that I came to study. In fact, I later learned that it's a bit controversial among music theorists, and some of the other professors were openly indifferent to it.

The tech meetup part

With no chance of getting a PhD, I wrapped up my studies with just another MA. Being in Seattle, I couldn't help but hear about the startup scene. Still stinging from my missed opportunity with the record labels, I had an idea for a startup of my own: a band incubator to connect ambitious musicians. Hoping to find a technical cofounder, I attended tech meetups. But no one wanted to join my startup. I mostly ended up just scoring free food.

However, through these meetups, I kept hearing about something called a coding bootcamp. It seemed too good to be true. I applied and was accepted into General Assembly's second cohort. One day, we took a field trip to a company called Zillow. The name sounded familiar. As I stepped into the office, I realized I'd been there before, for a tech meetup.

The Zillow part

We sat in the classroom on floor 29, as Josh Ritter answered our questions. Everyone we met was so warm and friendly. I loved their energy and spirit. Admittedly, the free snacks and ocean view also won me over! I vowed right then and there to work at Zillow. After applying, I spent every waking hour of the next few weeks preparing for the interview. I got the offer.

I was the first developer on a new team called Rentals Revenue. My manager, Mark Winham, had started a few weeks earlier. To tackle my imposter syndrome, I decided to spend the first half year getting better at coding by working late. In the meantime, I would figure out what the next several years would look like for me. I was still committed to my lifelong ambition of making it in a band, and there was no doubt I'd eventually come back to it. It was just a question of how and when.

My friends advised me to play local shows in my free time, but I knew this wasn't feasible. As a dishwasher, I could switch hats easily because it wasn't a job I cared about. Whereas, as a developer, I would continue to think about coding after work, which wasn't a bad thing. It challenged and engaged me. But this also meant I wasn't in the right headspace to write songs.

I needed an artistic project that could align with my Zillow work. So I decided to create an audio webcomic for my epic demo. For the next five years, I would put in forty hours a week at Zillow, and then another forty hours on this project. I've now logged more than 10,000 hours on this webcomic!

Over the years, everything I learned about frontend coding at Zillow would also benefit my own project: Redux, React hooks, Jest mocking. And occasionally, the reverse happened: I would spend hours trying to fix a scrolling issue on my own project, and then take minutes when the same issue showed up in our team's code. After E.K. Yancy joined, the frontend best practices he introduced to our team improved my own project by leaps and bounds.

One of the things I appreciate most about Zillow is the understanding that leadership and teamwork don't come naturally. They're skills that can be taught. Whenever we attended training sessions on effective communication

Years later, I tried as a manager for a summer intern.

When the pandemic hit, I appreciated that 

A couple months ago, I took my R&R. For the first time in a long while, I was able to devote every waking hour to my projects. Since I no longer had to context switch, I was logging a hundred hours each week. It was heaven! So when I came back to work after the six weeks was up… I found it really, really hard to escape the gravity of my projects. After a while, I realized this wasn't fair to my team, and I gave notice.

And please check out my band, the Bobtail Yearlings!

Let me make a prediction now: Within a year, the Bobtail Yearlings will be signed to a record label on par with those under Secretly Group. So if I fail, it will live on forever in this zWiki, and I'll be super embarrassed, ha.
