Farewell, and please check out the Bobtail Yearlings

Hi everyone,

I'm writing to let you know that June 20 will be my last day at Zillow. I'm leaving to pursue my lifelong ambition of making it in a band.

To say farewell, I've decided to combine the Mark Winham approach of sending a group email addressed to individuals, with the Tim Stevens approach of creating a zWiki page that's more of a personal reflection.

To Andrea and Brittany, Iâ€™ll always have fond memories of our team as it went through so many transitions. Thank you for opening up to me. It feels like we've all grown together.

To Braydon, Chelsea, E.K., Maja, and Stephens, I've learned so much working with each of you, and I'll always be grateful for those experiences. I will miss the camaraderie that I felt coming into the office each morning.

To Amritha and Emily, thank you for having confidence in my abilities. I'll always look to you as models of effective management.

To Csaba, Srinath, and Youna, it was wonderful to finally meet you in person. I had a lot of fun building out new features with you this past year.

To Christopher, Douglas, and Sean, thank you for making yourselves available to chat with me. I was always amazed how much access I had to our leadership at Zillow.

To those of you in Rentals, I'll never forget working on Project Comet. It felt like we were all in Mission Control and shooting for the moon. And since then, I've enjoyed collaborating and engaging with you on various projects.

To Esther, Josh, Minhao, and Scott, thank you for interviewing me and giving a chance to a bootcamp graduate. Your decision changed my life. And Scott, thank you for being my zPal.

To Aaron, Clark, and James, thank you for agreeing to do headshots for my webcomic. If you're curious, this scene shows all the characters. (And yes, those are former Zillowites Ashley Douthett, Graham Young, Matt Viele, and Vicki Huang as well.)

To everyone else, thank you for embodying the spirit and warmth of Zillow. It made my time here so memorable. I'll always be cheering for Zillow from the sidelines!

I'm happy to connect with anyone here.

And if you're interested, here are some musical projects related to my band, the Bobtail Yearlings. They're all still in the early stages, so if you check them out now, it won't even seem like we're a real band, ha. But they'll be built out in the coming months.
