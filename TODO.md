    * Radio was a musical proving ground
        * If you had taste in the '90s, every band you liked was one of three types: those like Nirvana, who were loved by both critics *and* musicians; those like Pavement, who were adored by *critics* but ignored by musicians; and those like Stone Temple Pilots, who were hated by critics but [admired by *musicians*](https://youtu.be/aVfU0wljJbA).

### ${++sectionCounter}. Anxiety of influence is a needed scare

// TODO: New section. Anxiety of influence.

Without a critical mass of people willing to say the art of our times sucks, we'll never get over the inertia of our dislike for innovation.

https://www.ian-leslie.com/p/how-to-be-influenced
https://nevermindgenx.substack.com/p/the-ainguish-of-influence
https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2000/02/10/the-panic-of-influence/?lp_txn_id=1595126

* Before, or after, mastery?
    * Ultimately depends on how I write it, I think

* Anxiety of influence is a good scare
    * Needs to be about indie, though
    * Kurt Cobain
        * Already thought music was rehashed and plagiarized in his own time
        * Thought it would be worse twenty years later
    * Make it all about not aging well
        * Which explains why Millennials' tastes have aged so badly
        * Without anxiety of influence, a generation will always give in to the temptation of doing things that don't age well
            * By virtue of not aging well, they aren't done, and hence aren't common, and hence it comes across as subversion to do it
    * Call it artistic pessimism, artistic anxiety, or declinism

Mention hair metal era, how Millennials didn't see that an entire generation's worth of music was rendered irrelevant and obsolete in an instant.

Maybe move the Andrew W.K. talk in mastery section to the anxiety of influence section? Make this more about Millennials thinking you can have it all. Nothing takes away from anything else. So take heart that the ones who get the job are also most definitely the ones who deserve it. Re-read to look for something to link to:

Things that don't age well.

Guess who had no problem accepting that music was getting worse: Kurt Cobain himself!

Millennials don't know they're Millennials. They don't know that their need to stifle discontent, and to get everyone onboard with the status quo, is a historical anomaly.
