### ${++sectionCounter}. Lean operations fail to adapt

// TODO: New section. Lean operations.

Much earlier. Maybe between lottery and support? End by talking about support? Or between creativity and disintermediation?

Talk about redundancy of middlemen, and indie labels getting rid of them. Redundancy keeps system robust against any single point of failure.

Mention supporting artists, to segue into charitable support section.

Word of mouth, fan engagement.

Don't mention tech at all, that's covered later.

The indie labels are overworked and underpaid; they do what they do as a labor of love. As a result, they're lean operations. And yet, this is precisely their selling point: By *not* involving so many middlemen, they pass the benefits onto the artist, who gets to keep more of the earnings generated by their works. And to conserve energy, lean operations must rely on instinct.

Before the Internet, underground bands were the *only* ones winning over one fan at a time from the bottom up. Thus, Indie labels developed an instinct to respect and reward fan engagement. Like moths that evolved to navigate by moonlight, and then conserve their brainpower to never do differently.

But lean operations also have single point of failure. Can't adapt to changes. But the world has evolved, causing moths to burn themselves in flames. Indie labels are just as misguided, in a world where tech platforms have made fan engagement the default behavior, the indies will always dismiss the unexpected. Happily, BYCombo helps

### ${++sectionCounter}. Anxiety of influence is a needed scare

// TODO: New section. Anxiety of influence.

Without a critical mass of people willing to say the art of our times sucks, we'll never get over the inertia of our dislike for innovation.

    * Needs to be about indie, though
    * Kurt Cobain
        * Already thought music was rehashed and plagiarized in his own time
        * Thought it would be worse twenty years later
    * Make it all about not aging well
        * Which explains why Millennials' tastes have aged so badly
        * Without anxiety of influence, a generation will always give in to the temptation of doing things that don't age well
            * By virtue of not aging well, they aren't done, and hence aren't common, and hence it comes across as subversion to do it
    * Call it artistic pessimism, artistic anxiety, or declinism

Mention hair metal era, how Millennials didn't see that an entire generation's worth of music was rendered irrelevant and obsolete in an instant.

Maybe move the Andrew W.K. talk in mastery section to the anxiety of influence section? Make this more about Millennials thinking you can have it all. Nothing takes away from anything else. So take heart that the ones who get the job are also most definitely the ones who deserve it. Re-read to look for something to link to:

Things that don't age well.

Guess who had no problem accepting that music was getting worse: Kurt Cobain himself!

Millennials don't know they're Millennials. They don't know that their need to stifle discontent, and to get everyone onboard with the status quo, is a historical anomaly.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Welfare gets cut by past beneficiaries

Major labels are the social welfare of music.

After democratization? (Mention of indieocracy.) But before elitism? (Mention of legacy institutions.) Between hustlers and paid dues? (Theme of not caring about the future, followed by theme of widening vicious circle.)

Explicitly mention cultural libertarianism and cultural progressivism.

Research: Who's more conservative, Boomers or Gen X?

Imagine if Boomers, who benefited from an expanded welfare state, decided they wouldn't pay it forward after all, and instead they'd tear it all down… and Gen X cheered.

Yet Gen X artists, who benefited from legacy institutions of major labels, decided they wouldn't pay it forward after all, and instead they'd tear it all down… well, Millennials cheered.

Why people hate paying it forward. Bring up [Pareto principle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paretoprinciple.asp) here. Major labels, like governments, bet on the outsized earnings of a few to subsidize the rest. But everyone resents this. The successful assume they could've succeeded without help. The less successful resent not being given more help.
https://usafacts.org/articles/who-pays-the-most-income-tax

Nobody who gains from strong centralized systems loves them, while those who have to pay in hate them.

This is a different point, I think: Explain indieocracy? History is a top down affair. Be clear that decentralization and bottom up isn't about distribution, but decision-making. Use scraps from homogeneity, as well as salvation sections.

Faith in institutions.

Indiefication begins with those who benefited from legacy institutions. They go indie, and then lend a veneer of credibility to the indie culture, understating how much the indie culture can actually nurture talent. Such that, when people hear that a work is "indie," they automatically assume it's better. I saw this happen with indie rock. A generation later, it's happening with writers on Substack.

Mention "enshittification"?

You should expect the best art to come out of "pay it forward" programs. Indiefication

### ${++sectionCounter}. True progressives join the establishment

Before or after countercultures? Probably best between elitism and countercultures. But it also makes a point related to prejudice and penultimate tolerance? So maybe best between penultimate and underdogs. May need to determine only once it's been fleshed out.

Make this one continuation of "sideways horseshoe." Just mention cultural progressivism, not cultural libertarianism. Cultural libertarianism will be in welfare and system sections.
Do mention populism, as opposed to elitism, here.

First paragraph:
In high school, a friend referred to carpetbaggers as history's "bad guys"— for exploiting the defeated South. This surprised me, since I saw them as "good guys"— for protecting Blacks. Clearly, he was a populist who sided with the people, while I sided with the elites and the underclass. In other words, the "sideways horseshoe" doesn't just happen in culture, but in politics as well!

Second paragraph:
Talk about today's political progressivism. Mention establishment?
In the past, populists intuitively understood that populism was like centrism. New Deal. But today, Millennials have been trying to steer the world towards a kind of populism that can't and doesn't exist: one that *doesn't* abandon the underclass. Unfortunately, this dooms them, making their politics ineffective. They hate the major parties.

Third paragraph:
Talk about today's cultural progressivism. Mention establishment here as well?
Culture. Today's carpetbaggers are the major labels and middlemen.

Fourth and fifth paragraphs:
Make my "startling conclusion" in the next two paragraphs.
An entire generation of progressives who would have sided with an alliance of the elites and the underclass— had the concept of the sideways horseshoe been better understood at the time— instead chose to side with the people while opposing the elites— and thereby ended up opposing the underclass as well. As a result, the causes of both cultural and political progressivism were held back for two decades.

This inability to understand the sideways horseshoe made Millennials ineffective in the arts.

Talk about Republican party, New Deal. A true progressive can certainly ally with populists, but can never fully be one, because true populists *must* abandon the underclass.

Every populist movement in the past abandoned the underclass. The modern-day assumption is that those were less tolerant times, and that this should no longer happen in our tolerant present. But it could simply be that it's the timeless nature of populism to abandon the underclass, because it's the timeless nature of the very top and very bottom to have opposition to the middle in common, just like it's the timeless nature of the far left and far right to have opposition to the center in common.

Past populists intuitively understood the sideways horseshoe, even if they didn't have a term for it. When they vilified the carpetbagger, for example, they knew full well that the Black neighbors didn't feel the same.

In our increasingly tolerant society, however…
By contrast, today's populists *don't* intuitively understand the sideways horseshoe. As such, they don't understand that when they vilify the middleman, minorities like myself don't feel the same.

This is the reason both culture and politics have gotten worse: In both cases, we've mistaken populism for progressivism. As such, progressivism has slowly been replaced by populism.

Because the sideways horseshoe is timeless, populism can't be effective unless it opposes both the very top and very bottom, just like true centrism is only effective if it opposes both the far left and far right.

Progressives can't be populists, because a true populist abandons the underclass. In other words, a true progressive allows the underclass to join the establishment— and in doing so, ends up joining themselves.

Takeaway:
A true outsider doesn't wish to *remain* an outsider. They want a pathway to joining those at the top.

The problem with progressivism is the same problem with the arts: For the past two decades, there's been an absence of a culturally progressive identity to counter indie rock's culturally libertarian identity. This is a problem because the cultural libertarian believes there are only two classes, the elites and the people. Only the cultural progressive understands there's a third class, the disadvantaged, who *want* the elites to *protect* them from the people. As a result, people who otherwise would have been elites refuse to behave like elites. They refuse the privileges of the elites, which means they also shirk the duties of the elites.

Indie rock taught an entire generation of political progressives to be cultural libertarians. Anti-elitist elites.

Third paragraph:
(Describe what candidate you should want as a progressive, and how this requires an interdependent mindset. Being anti-establishment is a poor fit for progressives.)
But I'll go a step further, and argue that indie rock's anti-elitist elites also made Millennials ineffective as *political* progressives. After all, to promote social welfare, you need an administrative state. Which means you want candidates who…

Fourth paragraph:
(Describe the indie archetype of an anti-establishment candidate, and how this fits more with libertarian principles.)
Because progressive Millennials were inexplicably libertarian in their *cultural* outlook, however, they idealized candidates
People who should have defended institutions instead were bent on destroying them. Millennials gave us the indieocracy of Donald Trump. They might not have wanted him particularly, but they wanted "indie" candidates— and Trump is the most indie candidate.

To be indie is, by definition, to find coalitions distasteful. Joining coalitions require working with people who think differently from you.

Let's face it, the disadvantaged fundamentally depend on noblesse oblige, which *only* the elites can provide. But while the indie tastemakers are positioned to behave like elites, they shirk any duty to do so, and instead, obey the will of the people— who then favor the privileged!

https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/opinion/elites-progressives-universities.html

True progressives effect change. They don't worry about maintaining an identity.

Criticizing the idea that solutions are simple:

https://jasonpargin.substack.com/p/is-modern-mass-media-a-mind-prison
https://maxread.substack.com/p/the-tiktok-electorate

So the lack of an interdependent counterculture meant interdependence was never seen by Millennials as a viable alternative. And cultural progressivism was never seen as a viable alternative to cultural libertarianism. The only way to be a political progressive is to be a cultural libertarian— to abhor morally compromised coalitions.

In the same way that indie rock convinced Millennials that being indie is the only respectable way to be an artist, it also convinced them that being anti-establishment is the only respectable way to be a progressive. Despite all the evidence that women and minority artists actually prefer to be interdependent with the cultural elites, and women and minority voters actually prefer to work with the political establishment.

Fifth paragraph:
Here's my belief: Since I was helpless to start a counterculture of interdependence on my own, for the past two decades, "interdependent" couldn't stand against "indie" as its own identity. So there was romance associated with destroying coalitions, while none associated with building them.

Indie rock prepared Millennials for indieocracy— rule by those who hustle to get the job.

We need a competing interdependence counterculture that's equally romantic.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Salvation comes from thinking in systems

Definitely put after happiness, which talks about the soul. And before explanation, which mentions systems thinking.

However, revisit after elitism section is revised, and progressives section is finalized.

https://nevermindgenx.substack.com/p/why-is-gen-x-so-reactionary

A cultural libertarian today is a leading candidate to become a political libertarian tomorrow. This is because, if your personal identity is so tied to this romantic notion of lashing out against centralized institutions, then why *wouldn't* you eventually lash out against the biggest one of them all— the government? And if you're young, educated, White, and/or male, then why *wouldn't* your personal fortunes change for the better, enough to suddenly make political libertarianism attractive?

First paragraph— compress these three into a single cohesive statement:
Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful to the White men of Gen X for making so much of the art that I love. But indie rock, the culturally libertarian movement they founded, was always a poor fit for me. As an Asian male— the demographic with the least cultural standing— I *need* a cultural "safety net"; in other words, I need the elites to intervene if they see my potential, even when the people don't.
When the torch finally passed to Millennials, then, I expected them to defend the interdependence I craved, given our shared desire to see more female and minority artists. Instead… they *cheered* as indie rock took over?! So they chose the path of cultural *libertarianism*… to achieve the goals of cultural *progressivism*! No wonder the culture they gave us was so lacking…
Why are both progressivism and the arts in such rough shape after the last two decades? I suspect it's because indie rock's cultural libertarianism taught us that siding with the underdog means taking down "the system." So we lash out against those we see as shadowy forces— the political establishment, the cultural elites— thinking we do so in solidarity with the less privileged.

Yet the *least* privileged groups want to *join* the establishment! "Why *fight* the power, if we're being invited to *share* in it?" Similarly, the *least* privileged artists hope to *partner* with the elites. So the guiding principles that indie rock instilled in us… are flat-out *wrong*! Hopefully, my fellow progressives get this, and will now course correct in their politics.

In the arts, however, we face an additional problem: Past artists could rail against the system while still benefiting from it, as they had no other choice. But today's self-empowered artists *can't* pretend this is still the case. The only way to benefit from the system now is to openly declare the intent to work with it. But there's only romance in fighting the system, not in working with it.

So how do we win over the new Romantics? I believe the answer is to appreciate systems in all their complexity and fragility. Once we do, we'll stop blaming shadowy forces for our problems, because we'll finally know to examine them well enough to find constructive solutions instead. Only then will we proudly self-identify as interdependent, setting an example for others to do the same.

Reiterate cultural progressivism in fifth paragraph.
If I could get everyone in the arts to read just one book, it would be [*Thinking in Systems*](https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/thinking-in-systems) by Donella Meadows. It helped lead to so many of the ideas that went into structuring how BYCombo will work, my solution for fixing the arts. And hopefully, it can lead you to some of your own ideas as well.
