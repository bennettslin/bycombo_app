### ${++sectionCounter}. Automation fails to adapt

// TODO: New section. Lean operations.

Much earlier. Maybe between lottery and support? End by talking about support? Or between creativity and disintermediation?

First paragraph:
List why it was once understandable that indie rock respected what it respects. Building a fanbase on one's own took initiative. Engaging directly with fans was something you could only do at a live show. Nonchalance of Pavement.

Second paragraph:
Point out that these things no longer signify what they once did. Yet indie rock carries on as if the world hadn't changed. Why?

Third paragraph:
Every indie tastemaker is overworked and underpaid; they do what they do as a labor of love. Like moth, it evolved to minimize mental overhead. Path of least resistance.

Fourth paragraph:

Talk about redundancy of middlemen, and indie labels promise to get rid of them. Redundancy keeps system robust against any single point of failure.

Mention supporting artists, to segue into charitable support section.

Word of mouth, fan engagement. Make clear that indie rock respects direct fan engagement because it once took place mainly at local shows, which indie rock has always held in high esteem, as it's bottom up. (I removed this point from the introductory paragraphs.) As opposed to radio, which is top down.

Don't mention tech at all, that's covered later.

The indie labels are overworked and underpaid; they do what they do as a labor of love. As a result, they're lean operations. And yet, this is precisely their selling point: By *not* involving so many middlemen, they pass the benefits onto the artist, who gets to keep more of the earnings generated by their works. And to conserve energy, lean operations must rely on instinct.

Before the Internet, underground bands were the *only* ones winning over one fan at a time from the bottom up. Thus, Indie labels developed an instinct to respect and reward fan engagement. Like moths that evolved to navigate by moonlight, and then conserve their brainpower to never do differently.

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/jan/30/why-are-moths-attracted-to-lights-science-answer#:~:text=Despite%20the%20rich%20history%20of,light%20to%20escape%20imminent%20danger.

But lean operations also have single point of failure. Can't adapt to changes. But the world has evolved, causing moths to burn themselves in flames. Indie labels are just as misguided, in a world where tech platforms have made fan engagement the default behavior, the indies will always dismiss the unexpected. Happily, BYCombo helps

### ${++sectionCounter}. Anxiety of influence is a needed scare

// TODO: New section. Anxiety of influence.

Without a critical mass of people willing to say the art of our times sucks, we'll never get over the inertia of our dislike for innovation.

https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2000/02/10/the-panic-of-influence/?lp_txn_id=1595126

* Before, or after, mastery?
    * Ultimately depends on how I write it, I think

* Anxiety of influence is a good scare
    * Needs to be about indie, though
    * Kurt Cobain
        * Already thought music was rehashed and plagiarized in his own time
        * Thought it would be worse twenty years later
    * Make it all about not aging well
        * Which explains why Millennials' tastes have aged so badly
        * Without anxiety of influence, a generation will always give in to the temptation of doing things that don't age well
            * By virtue of not aging well, they aren't done, and hence aren't common, and hence it comes across as subversion to do it
    * Call it artistic pessimism, artistic anxiety, or declinism

Mention hair metal era, how Millennials didn't see that an entire generation's worth of music was rendered irrelevant and obsolete in an instant.

Maybe move the Andrew W.K. talk in mastery section to the anxiety of influence section? Make this more about Millennials thinking you can have it all. Nothing takes away from anything else. So take heart that the ones who get the job are also most definitely the ones who deserve it. Re-read to look for something to link to:

Things that don't age well.

Guess who had no problem accepting that music was getting worse: Kurt Cobain himself!

Millennials don't know they're Millennials. They don't know that their need to stifle discontent, and to get everyone onboard with the status quo, is a historical anomaly.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Welfare gets cut by past beneficiaries

Major labels are the social welfare of music.

After democratization? (Mention of indieocracy.) But before elitism? (Mention of legacy institutions.) Between hustlers and paid dues? (Theme of not caring about the future, followed by theme of widening vicious circle.) Or between modest standing and creativity? (Naturally leads to talk of Pareto distribution.)

Explicitly mention cultural libertarianism and cultural progressivism. Call it cultural welfare.

First paragraph:
Talk about Pareto principle.

Second paragraph:
Define welfare as paying it forward. Apply to political welfare.

Third paragraph:
Apply to cultural welfare.

Fourth paragraph:
Explain why people hate paying it forward. Nobody who gains from strong centralized systems loves them, while those who have to pay in hate them.

Fifth paragraph:
BYCombo.

Yet Gen X artists, who benefited from legacy institutions of major labels, decided they wouldn't pay it forward after all, and instead they'd tear it all down… well, Millennials cheered.

Why people hate paying it forward. Bring up [Pareto principle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paretoprinciple.asp) here. Major labels, like governments, bet on the outsized earnings of a few to subsidize the rest. But everyone resents this. The successful assume they could've succeeded without help. The less successful resent not being given more help.
https://usafacts.org/articles/who-pays-the-most-income-tax

This is a different point, I think: Explain indieocracy? History is a top down affair. Be clear that decentralization and bottom up isn't about distribution, but decision-making. Use scraps from homogeneity, as well as salvation sections.

Faith in institutions.

Indiefication begins with those who benefited from legacy institutions. They go indie, and then lend a veneer of credibility to the indie culture, understating how much the indie culture can actually nurture talent. Such that, when people hear that a work is "indie," they automatically assume it's better. I saw this happen with indie rock. A generation later, it's happening with writers on Substack.
