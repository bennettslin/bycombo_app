A long time ago, I was in a band with some friends of mine. We'd been playing out for several years, and I was frustrated that my friends didn't share my ambition to make it big. Yet I struggled to find ambitious bandmates elsewhere, because I didn't resemble any front person who'd ever made it before.

At the time, I was studying masterpieces like James Joyce's *Ulysses* and the Beatles' later albums, hoping to learn what makes a work great. As I read about how extensive the recording sessions were for *Sgt. Pepper's*, I realized that with home studios becoming more affordable, a band no longer needs to be established first to record a masterpiece. (Rework this.)

And then it dawned on me that I should create my own masterpiece, "The *Ulysses* of Rock Albums," a work so epic that I couldn't fail to make it. I assumed that others out there were thinking similarly, and I would emerge to find myself part of an exciting wave of new artists, each striving to make albums as epic as *Sgt. Pepper’s*.

But there was no new wave. Instead, upon its completion, every demo of *Yearling's Bobtail* was rejected. I soon understood why. With so many unknown bands hoping to be considered, the gatekeepers can only give each of us a minute of their time. Want another chance? Make another album.

Still, if it's hard for you, then it's hard for everyone. And so the most promising bands embrace the challenge. They tailor their creative approach toward maximizing their chances, taking advantage of constant feedback from frequent releases to get better.

But *Yearling's Bobtail* took me more than five years to create. It can only be appreciated after repeated listens. Yet there was no way to signal this. Even if it were possible, every other band would do the same. So I just kept trying to get the same work heard, over and over. Which is what you’d expect the *least* competent artists to do.

(Rephrase.)
An artist who tries to create “The *Ulysses* of Rock Albums,” in other words, is effectively the same as a Dunning-Kruger case, a person so incompetent they're incapable of realizing it. And this got me really excited. Because along with masterpieces, I'd also studied artistic revolutions. And revolution starts with the incompetent.

Let's clear up any misconceptions. Revolutions don’t start with the artists we already respect for being bold. If this were so, then a revolution could never win. It would just be an eternal struggle, as each incremental shifting of the needle meets new resistance. (Clear this up.)

No, revolutions have to start with the incompetent, with those we don’t even respect as real artists, like the early pioneers of jazz and hip hop. That's the only way they can win. As the world comes to understand that theirs is a new way to do competence. This is exactly what allows a revolution to gain the kind of strength and momentum that makes it seem inevitable in hindsight.

This phenomenon isn't limited to art. Henry Ford and Steve Jobs were seen as incompetent for trying to sell a worse car and a worse computer, respectively, when every other competitor was making theirs better. But worse products are also cheaper, and this allowed Ford and Jobs to build something from nothing— namely, a middle-class market for cars and computers. (Don't phrase it as building something from nothing. Phrase it as bringing in new participants.)

Revolution can’t begin and end with me.
