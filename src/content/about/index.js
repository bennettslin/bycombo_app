### So epic it couldn't fail

A long time ago, I was in a band with some friends of mine. We'd been playing out for several years, and I was frustrated that my friends didn't share my ambition to make it big. Yet I struggled to find ambitious bandmates elsewhere, because I didn't look like any front person who'd ever made it before.

At the time, I was studying masterpieces like James Joyce's *Ulysses* and the Beatles' later albums, hoping to learn what makes a work great. As I read about the extensive recording sessions for *Sgt. Pepper's*, I realized something. With home studios becoming more affordable, a band no longer needed to be established to record their first masterpiece.

And then it hit me. I should create a masterpiece, "The *Ulysses* of Rock Albums," on my own. It would be so epic that I couldn't fail to make it big. I assumed that others out there were thinking similarly, and I would emerge to find myself part of an exciting wave of new bands, each striving to be as good as the Beatles.

### A Dunning-Kruger artist

But there was no new wave. Instead, upon completion, every demo of *Yearling's Bobtail* was rejected. I soon understood why. With so many unknown bands hoping to be considered, the gatekeepers can only grant each release the same fleeting first impression. Want another chance? Put out another release.

Still, what's hard for one is hard for all. And so the most promising bands embrace the system, maximizing their chances by putting out more and frequent releases.

But *Yearling's Bobtail* took more than five years to create. It hides layers of meaning that are revealed upon repeated listens. And there was no way for me to signal this. If it were possible, then every other band would do the same. So I just kept trying to get the same work heard, again and again. But this is what the *least* competent artists do, because they don't understand that rejection can be used to get better.

An artist who creates “The *Ulysses* of Rock Albums,” in other words, will get lumped in with those who suffer from the Dunning-Kruger effect. They will seem too incompetent to even recognize their own incompetence.

### Building from nothing

But far from discouraging me, this got me excited. Because along with studying masterpieces, I'd also studied artistic revolutions. And revolution starts with those we dismiss as incompetent.

Every now and then, some underground bands we respect are welcomed into the mainstream. This is a minor revolution. There is no momentum, because each incremental shift of the needle faces new resistance. The next cohort is now the one whose music is too raw, or too experimental, for a mainstream audience.

But a major revolution starts with those we see as incompetent, like the early pioneers of jazz or hip hop. As they compel us to revise our notion of competence, others who were shut out before can now join, some of whom will push the boundaries further. And so, starting from nothing, the revolution gains momentum as it builds up in a virtuous circle, making it seem inevitable in hindsight.

This phenomenon isn't limited to art. Henry Ford and Steve Jobs were derided as incompetent for trying to sell a worse car and worse computer, respectively. But worse products are cheaper, and this allowed them to build something from nothing— namely, a middle-class market for cars and computers.

### The masterpiece revolution

It's not hard to imagine *Yearling's Bobtail* leading to a virtuous circle, where bands spend more time and work harder to merit greater consideration for the same work. And yet, if each of these bands has to go through the same wringer that I did, then this masterpiece revolution will begin and end with me. BYCombo seeks to prevent that.

The good news is that no one ever declared the Bobtail Yearlings to be incompetent. We were simply undone by a system streamlined to weed out incompetence. Which means that hearts and minds don't need to change. The problem is systemic, and so the solution will be likewise.

Gatekeepers will always be egalitarian. Only more time spent can ever be respected as a metric to signal that a work deserves further consideration.

Bring together artists committed to spending the time to create a masterpiece. They can enforce a culture of a strong work ethic amongst themselves.
