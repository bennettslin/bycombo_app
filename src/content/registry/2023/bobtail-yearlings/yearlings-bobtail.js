**How does this advance the art form?**

Our hope was to do for music what James Joyce's *Ulysses* did for literature. Lyrical experiments include [stream of consciousness](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/8-good-night-sita/?annotation=2), [neologistic puns](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/10-constellations/?annotation=9), and a literary device we invented called [doublespeaker rhyme](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/4-odin/?annotation=7).

Musical experiments include [Tuvan throat singing](https://yearlingsbobtail.com/5-pchelkas-starry-journey/?annotation=4), [Arabic quarter tones](https://yearlingsbobtail.com/6-ash-wednesday/?annotation=17), and [Shepard tones](https://yearlingsbobtail.com/16-cremated/?annotation=4).

The audio webcomic explores the possibilities of combining music with visual storytelling, beyond what the conventional platforms allow.

Once our demo is known to the public, other bands will be encouraged to spend all *their* time and energy on the craft as well. This will lead to a rock renaissance!

**What else does our band have to offer?**

[*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com) is a lesson book that teaches artists to write melodies and chords as a single, organic whole. We plan to release an app version.

[*Bobtail Dominoes*](https://bobtaildominoes.com) is a tile game that trains musicians to visualize chordal space. We'll create both an app and a tabletop version.

We've already written all the songs for the second album, as well as the melodies and chords for the third album. And they're some of our best!

[Amnesticism](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/23566) is a theory for composing tonal music in multidimensional virtual spaces. We'll continue to develop it in the long term.

After attending a coding bootcamp, Bennett worked for years as a coder while living like a pauper. As such, he managed to save up a million dollars, which we'll now spend to market and promote our band.

**Who are we looking for?**

We're looking for someone to join our band in a full-time [admin position](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com/writings/ongoing/our-mission-principles-and-terms/#roles), as an [equally paid](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com/writings/ongoing/our-mission-principles-and-terms/#compensation) member. You would handle our administrative work, take on a leadership role at BYCombo, and oversee development of Bobtail Method and Bobtail Dominoes.

We also hope to hear from business partners who'd like to work with our band in any way: managers, publicists, and labels.
