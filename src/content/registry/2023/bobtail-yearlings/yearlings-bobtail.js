    description: `A double album and audio webcomic for the "*Ulysses* of rock albums."`,
    body: `
Our vision was to do for music what James Joyce's *Ulysses* did for literature. As such, the lyrics experiment with stream of consciousness ("[Good Night, Sita](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/8-good-night-sita)"), meta-reference ("[Grasshoppers Lie Heavy](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/9-grasshoppers-lie-heavy)"), and neologistic puns ("[Constellations!](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/10-constellations)"). We also invented a literary device called doublespeaker rhyme, in which two sets of lyrics that rhyme syllable for syllable are panned hard into opposite speakers ("[Odin](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/4-odin)," "[On a Golden Cord](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/13-on-a-golden-cord)," "[Cremated](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/16-cremated)").

Musically, the styles range from Tuvan throatsinging ("Pchelka's Starry Journey") to Arabic quarter tones ("Ash Wednesday"). The album also includes Shepard tones ("Cremated"), an auditory illusion in which a tone gradually descends in pitch while remaining fixed in place.
