    body: `
**How does this advance the art form?**

Ulysses of rock albums. Doublespeaker rhyme.

Audio webcomic.

Proof of concept.

**What else does our band have to offer?**

[*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com) is a lesson book that teaches artists to write melodies and chords as a single, organic whole. We plan to release an app version.

[*Bobtail Dominoes*](https://bobtaildominoes.com) is a tile game that trains musicians to visualize chordal space. We'll create both an app and a tabletop version.

We've already written all the songs for the second album, as well as the melodies and chords for the third album. And they're some of our best!

[Amnesticism](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/23566) is a theory for composing tonal music in multidimensional virtual spaces. We'll continue to develop it in the long term.

A million dollars.

**Who are we looking for?**

Partner.

Label.
