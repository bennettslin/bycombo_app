# The problem with indie rock

By the 90s, the major labels no longer invested in their artists. They simply counted on a few superstars to break out, like Nirvana and Radiohead; the rest were then written off as failed bets. But the indie labels held to fair standards that promised *all* their artists a working future. A decade later, the majors imploded— so indie rock won! Except now…

Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com/essays/ongoing/band-mission-and-principles) here. I've spent half my life arguing that indie rock has made music *worse*, to no avail. But in recent years, something amazing has happened: Young people have grown disillusioned, and some now agree with me. It turns out, they'd *love* to have a Nirvana or Radiohead of their own. So the interdependence revolution can finally begin!

There's just one problem: Indie rock didn't just lock in a permanent system of administration, assured of its moral righteousness— it's the *first* ideology in rock *ever* to do so. So how do we revolt, when there's no historical precedent to teach us how— or even to assure us that we *can*? Luckily, I've also spent half my life figuring out a solution:

**BYCombo will assemble interdependent bands who'll sacrifice serious chunks of lifetime to make historically consequential demos, which we'll then show in a public registry to sustain an anti-indie counterculture.**

### The revolution will *not* be decentralized

Okay, that's a mouthful! Let's break it down…

**Why BYCombo?**

It's all but certain that history's greatest rock bands had no peers who were better than them, yet somehow remained unknown. But the same can't be said of today's acclaimed indie artists, who *never* go above and beyond. Why don't they?

The answer lies in indie rock's decentralized nature, which requires artists to build a fanbase on their own. Happily enough, the returns on this effort are cumulative, as each fan brings in more fans. But not only that, with no talent scouts out there discovering artists, it's a huge disadvantage *not* to.

Going above and beyond, on the other hand, yields *marginal* returns for *massive* effort— yet, by definition, it *isn't* a disadvantage simply not to! So any band who does so anyway, in the hope to remain peerless, will end up the biggest loser. How does rock fix this perverse incentive? There's only one lever to pull: We must turn to *centralized* initiatives like BYCombo.

**Why an anti-indie counterculture?**

A counterculture is needed to protect dangerous ideas, yet we haven't had one for some time. Meanwhile, despite indie rock's good intentions, rock has gotten worse. But what if rock is worse… *because* of these good intentions? What if all this charitable support for indie *artists*… is actually bad for *art*? It's a dangerous idea, yet it might be rock's only hope— so let's protect it.

**Why historical consequence?**

Critical acclaim can be inflated, which makes it a terrible barometer. What *can't* be hacked is the historical canon, because making history means competing on equal terms with past artists who *didn't* rely on charitable support. In this light, it's likely that *no* indie artist today will be inducted— and *this* is why people gripe that rock is getting worse.

**Why assembled bands?**

Has rock explored all the ways a band can come together? It might seem so— assuming they'll always form on their own, in a decentralized free-for-all. But once we ditch this notion? Then rock has barely scratched the surface.

What if musicians hoping to form history-making bands could flock to a single hub from across the globe? What if a cartoonist could also join— and bands, in turn, could think to look for one? Or, suppose the next Kurt Cobain or Thom Yorke is a woman or minority who's struggling right now to find bandmates. What if they could ask to be judged without unconscious bias?

With so many ways left to innovate in this space, there most certainly *are* canonical bands still to come. All that's needed are centralized initiatives like BYCombo to help them come together.

**Why interdependence?**

To make consequential art, a band must develop exceptional strengths. But this isn't humanly possible unless they're allowed to stay weak in areas of administration like marketing and distribution, where a *partner* can be more efficient. That is to say, history-making bands need to be *inter*-dependent, not *indie*-pendent. They *need* a label, or some other business partner.

**Why demos?**

A demo shows what a work can be in the *future*, with a partner's help. This doesn't just free a band to take creative risks; it awakens the very thought to do so— with [doublespeaker rhyme](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/4-odin/?annotation=7) being my own example. Yes, artists today can self-release their works— but this is a *curse*, not a *blessing*. Past artists put out *demos*, and to compete with them means doing likewise.

**Why a public registry?**

It takes time to review an ambitious demo— but the indie labels won't ever put in this effort, since *any* artist they sign will be charitably supported just the same. So an interdependent band's best hope is to join a counterculture that *questions* indie rock's good intentions— and a public registry is where sympathetic fans and potential partners will know to find them.

**Why serious chunks of lifetime?**

Low barriers to entry have allowed an endless stream of underwhelming artists to pour through, leading people to grow wary and lose interest. But indie rock has no way to reverse this damage, given its decentralized nature.

To save rock, then, a centralized initiative like BYCombo must now step up to enforce a steep *cost* of entry. This cost can't be arbitrary or artificial, so it can only be one thing: a serious chunk of lifetime. After all, a lifetime is all you have; once that chunk is gone, it's *gone*! Which means there's nothing more precious that a band can sacrifice to restore the public's faith.

**And finally… how has indie rock made music worse?**

Here's an incomplete list of ways…

### History remembers hooks

A while back, I sent manuscripts of my songwriting book [*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com) to all the indie labels. None were interested… and I soon figured out why. It takes time to compose a strong melody and chord progression— but indie artists are required to spend their time building a fanbase instead. As such, indie music is proudly *defined* by its lack of hooks with widespread appeal.

Yet few of us care that a past artist built a fanbase on their own, while nearly everyone loves a past work with well-crafted hooks— and future generations will be no different. There's just no way around it: Making history starts with crafting your best hooks. So BYCombo gives you all the time you need.

### Revelations require a single hat

Indie rock requires its artists to wear several hats: the influencer hat, the publicist hat… of course, the best among them don't skimp on wearing the artist hat. They want their art to stay on par with their talents. Yet the best works of art are even *better* than the artists who make them. Why?

It's because they *also* benefit from insightful revelations that stem from the unconscious and can't be summoned at will. These revelations emerge when your thoughts drift in the shower, or you daydream out of boredom— but this won't happen if you're always context switching. So keep your artist hat on. *You* want your art to be better than you, and so does BYCombo.

### Middle managers join the revolution *last*

In his book [*Originals*](https://adamgrant.net/book/originals), Adam Grant points out that in any business hierarchy, the ones most eager to take risks are those safely perched at the top, as well as those at the bottom with nothing to lose. Those in the middle, by contrast, are the most risk averse. And who are these risk-averse middle managers in *rock*? The indie labels.

Because indie labels have just enough standing to lose, they only make *safe* bets. And the safest bet is to give the people what they [already want](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/988332). But this creates an echo chamber— the same kind that makes streaming algorithms so detrimental to art. Even worse, every revolution gets nipped in the bud, because the people *never* ask for revolutionary change on their own.

Revolutions may *start* with artists, but they're *spread* by business partners, whose know-how is key to winning over the public. This makes it crucial for such artists to find partners who share their appetite for risk. So BYCombo helps them reach industry executives who are well-funded enough to make *smart* bets, as well as budding entrepreneurs with no standing to lose.

### Competitive self-reliance favors privilege

Indie rock promotes self-reliance by empowering artists to do the middleman's job for themselves. But if the work is that simple, then those with wealth can just pay *others* to do it— and, well, who better to hire than a former middleman?! Ironically, then, indie rock has done little more than shift the advantage toward the privileged. How did this happen?

The problem is that indie rock enjoys the goodwill generated by artistic movements of *cooperative* self-reliance, like the [Maker Faire](https://makerfaire.com), that are united by love of the *craft*. But indie rock is really about *competitive* self-reliance, like libertarianism in politics; it's grounded in excitement for the *hustle*. And nothing makes the hustle easier— and thus more exciting— than privilege.

There's nothing wrong with indie rock's artistic libertarianism— but it's a *partisan* ideal that gets mistaken as *universal*. So when a band struggles to hustle because it's a poor fit for their circumstances, they're told to just suck it up and try harder. Now with BYCombo, there's an opposition party that advocates for the interdependence you want, out of respect for your craft.

### *For* hungry outsiders, *by* a hungry outsider

Who foresaw indie rock's ironic endgame? Minorities did— which is why they've never founded a movement that rewards self-reliance. By the way, don't be misled by hip hop's bravado: When rappers boast of past hustles, what they're really saying is, "Hey, *I* hustled *too*." It's to *prevent* self-reliance from offering an easy way for *rivals* to earn respect.

Don't be fooled, either, by indie rock's belated embrace of minority artists. They've been handed the reins *because* it's in decline; these are crumbs on offer here. No, the best movements for minorities are the ones *they* start *themselves*, that reflect *their* circumstances— and thus reward what can't be bought: originality and talent, born from an outsider's hunger.

Hip hop is the latest case in point, and BYCombo— which I founded to serve *all* disadvantaged groups— will be the next. As a minority myself, I know that disadvantage drives your instinct for *mutual* reliance, as well as your hunger to aim for the *top* of the pantheon.

### A artists help A artists, B artists help C artists

For many years, I worked days as a coder and nights on my audio webcomic. When I came back to the music world, I was surprised to hear indie artists speak of paying their dues— to justify, let's say, touring at a loss. In the tech world, "paid dues" is a synonym for "fake work"— and outsiders who see this, disrupt industries that don't. But why *don't* the disrupted ever see this?

It's because paid dues are worthless outside the one system that promises to honor them. As a result, once someone pays their dues, they'll fight to keep the system as it is.

Moreover, having squandered their potential to rack up symbolic credentials rather than build up actual talents, they can never feel secure enough to let others surpass them. So the only newcomers they'll accept are those willing to squander even *more* potential. But these newcomers will then feel even *less* secure— thus perpetuating a vicious circle.

Which is why it took an outsider like myself to start BYCombo, driven by an urge to help up-and-coming bands who might surpass me. My solution is so simple, I doubt I'm the first to think of it. Rather, I'm just the first artist who's secure enough to *want* it— having never paid indie rock's dues myself.

### Art needs the blood of martyrs

"Where's *our* Nirvana?" It's a question asked by today's young people. Well, there's an easy way to answer it: Can we imagine the *next* generation asking of any band today, "Where's *our* _____?" If so, then _____ is this generation's Nirvana. Of course, we can't— because this generation never got its Nirvana. Why is that?

It's because we really only pine for past artists who self-sacrificed for art's sake. But indie rock is here to *save* artists from exploitation, and so it roots for those who *empower* themselves instead. As such, today's indie artists demand to be fairly compensated; they don't self-sacrifice for *anyone*, because to do so is a classic sign of being exploited.

But the problems with this current Age of Empowerment go beyond its failure to give us the next Nirvana. For one, self-empowerment is really just self-serving, power-seeking behavior in those we see as underdogs; it's not noble in and of itself. For another, in a decentralized system, artists with this trait hold the *advantage*— so how exactly are *they* the underdogs?

Worst of all, self-empowered artists will never *start* a revolution, because the means to fair compensation get settled only at the *end*. To save rock, then, we need to make way for selfless bands who'll sacrifice themselves for art's sake. After Empowerment, in other words… comes the Age of Martyrdom.

Let's never go back to the days of musicians dying young, of course. But thankfully, history tells of another kind of martyr: those willing to sacrifice not their *lives*, but their *lifetimes*. What if this generation's Nirvana won't be just *one* selfless band, but an entire *movement* of them, each one sacrificing a serious chunk of lifetime to advance the art form?

Luckily, you don't need to ask, "Where's our BYCombo?" We're here for you *now*!
