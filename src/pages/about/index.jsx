# The problem with indie rock

Bennett here! I've spent half my life arguing that indie rock has made music worse, to no avail. But in recent years, something amazing has happened: Young people are disillusioned, and some now agree with me. Which means the interdependence revolution can finally begin!

There's just one problem: Indie rock isn't really a *genre* so much as it's a *system*. How do we revolt, when every system preserves a status quo by design? Luckily, I've spent half my life figuring this out as well:

**BYCombo will assemble interdependent bands who'll sacrifice serious chunks of lifetime to make historically consequential demos, which we'll keep in a public registry to sustain an anti-indie counterculture.**

### The revolution will *not* be decentralized

**Why an anti-indie counterculture?**

There hasn't been a counterculture for a while, yet they're needed to protect dangerous ideas. Meanwhile, even as indie rock has made music worse, the mainstream has adopted its good intentions. But… what if rock has gotten worse *because* of all this well-intentioned support for indie artists? It's a dangerous idea, yet it might be rock's only hope— so let's protect it.

**Why historical consequence? Why BYCombo?**

When people gripe about rock getting worse, they're *really* griping that history no longer gets made. Yes, talent is still out there— but competing with the past now calls for explicit intent and massive effort. And only a centralized force like BYCombo can light this fire in today's artists.

**Why assembled bands?**

There *are* revolutionary bands to come; they're just unlikely to come together on their *own* now. How do four musicians committed to making history find each other across the globe? How does a cartoonist or a dancer join as a full-fledged member? A centralized force is also needed to fully reimagine what a rock band can *be*.

**Why interdependence? Why demos?**

To make consequential art, a band needs to develop exceptional strengths. But this isn't humanly possible unless they stay weak in areas that a label will later cover. That is to say, history-making bands need to be *inter*-dependent, not *indie*-pendent; they *need* to partner with a label. And a demo is what their work will sound like before they've signed to one.

**Why a public registry?**

A demo that requires massive effort to *make* will also take more effort to *understand*— but the indie gatekeepers are too harried for this task. With a registry, the public can discover such revolutionary works on their own. This then allows the counterculture to offer interdependence as a *solution*, rather than just point out indie rock's *problems*.

**Why serious chunks of lifetime?**

Going forward, time spent making art will be the best predictor of artistic worth. And a lifetime is all you have; once that chunk is gone, it's *gone*. Which means there's nothing of greater value that an interdependent band can sacrifice to gain the public's trust.

**Why has indie rock made music worse?**

Here's an incomplete list of reasons…

### Art needs an opposition party

Political conservatives want socioeconomic *indie*-pendence. Which is fine, since no one mistakes this for a universal ideal. Liberals, their opponents, would rather have *inter*-dependence. And so we hold elections to promote healthy competition, as each of us decides which side speaks more to our circumstances.

Indie rock is clearly the conservative party of rock— yet its ideals are treated as universal, *not* partisan! So when bands struggle to be indie because it's a poor fit for their circumstances, they're just told to suck it up and try harder. With BYCombo, you can now join the opposition, which advocates for the interdependence you've always wanted but didn't know was possible.

### History wants hooks, not hustles

A while back, I sent manuscripts of my songwriting book [*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com) to all the indie labels. None were interested… and I soon figured out why. It takes time to compose a strong melody and chord progression, no less than it does to build a fanbase— and indie rock is all about the latter. As such, its aesthetic is proudly *defined* by a lack of widespread appeal.

But few of us care that a past artist hustled to build a fanbase, while nearly everyone loves a past work with well-crafted hooks— and future generations will surely feel the same. There's no way around it: Making history starts with composing your best hooks. So BYCombo gives you all the time you need.

### Insightful revelation requires a single hat

Indie rock requires artists to wear several hats: the influencer hat, the publicist hat… of course, the best among them don't skimp on wearing the artist hat. They want their art to stay on par with their level of talent.

But the best works of art are *better* than the artists who make them. Why? Because they *also* benefit from countless revelatory insights that can't be summoned at will. These insights come from letting thoughts drift in the shower, or even daydreaming out of boredom; they won't happen if you're always context switching. So BYCombo lets you keep the artist hat on.

### A pittance secures loyalty to the paradigm

In his book [*Originals*](https://adamgrant.net/book/originals), Adam Grant points out that in any hierarchy, the ones eager to take risks are those at the bottom with nothing to lose, and those safely perched at the top. By contrast, those in the middle are the most risk averse. This might explain why indie rock is so unoriginal. Its artists seek power while its labels relinquish it, with *no one* involved taking any risks.

Because indie artists strive to get paid from the get-go, they're instantly beholden to the current paradigm, which promises to empower them. For this reason, BYCombo encourages its bands to embrace being powerless and unpaid early on: While you have nothing to lose, what paradigms are you free to challenge?

### Masses join revolutions *last*

Meanwhile, because indie labels *lack* power, they only make safe bets. And the safest bet is to give the masses what they already want. But this creates an echo chamber— the same kind that makes streaming algorithms so detrimental to art. Even worse, every revolution will be nipped in the bud, because the masses have *never* accepted a paradigm change on their own.

Revolutions may *start* with powerless outsiders, but they're *spread* by powerful insiders. Far from exploiting such movements, those at the very top play a crucial role in getting buy-in from the masses. While this may not jibe with indie rock's anti-establishment fantasy, it's the historical truth. So BYCombo is happy to see its bands partner with powerful insiders.

### Responsible revolutions plan for runaway effects

Indie rock is a culture of self-reliance that celebrates artists who bypass the middleman. But if the middleman's job is simple enough for anyone to do, then wealthy artists can just pay *others* to do it— including, ironically, former middlemen. And so indie rock has become a trust fund playground, leading to today's disillusionment. Yet this was foreseeable from day one!

Won't BYCombo see a runaway effect as well? Yes, but it's foreseeably a race to the *top*. Taking the BYCombo approach to its absurd conclusion, a band might spend an *entire* lifetime on their demo— yet this basically *guarantees* they'll be remembered by history!

### *For* hungry outsiders, *by* a hungry outsider

Who foresaw indie rock's ironic endgame? Minorities did— which is why they've never founded a culture that rewards self-reliance. Instead, their movements value what can't be bought: originality and talent born from hunger. And BYCombo is the latest case in point.

Don't be fooled by indie rock's recent embrace of female and minority artists: They've been handed the reins *because* it's in decline. These are crumbs on offer here. Meanwhile, BYCombo was *conceived* to benefit disadvantaged groups. I know firsthand that disadvantage drives your instinct for *mutual* reliance, as well as your hunger to aim for the *top* of the pantheon.

### Art needs the blood of martyrs

Being indie means being self-empowered— but self-empowerment is just self-serving, power-seeking behavior in those we root for. It's not inherently noble; and worse, such artists *already* have the upper hand. Empowering them serves no purpose but to keep us from rooting for anyone else. So for the past generation… we haven't.

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Make shortened version make sense.
`}

But the farthest heights and ends of the art form can *never* be reached by self-serving power seekers; the personal costs are too great. And with rock now at its worst, young people are desperate to root for selfless bands who *will* make the sacrifice. After self-empowerment, in other words… comes the age of martyrdom.

Let's never go back to the days of musicians dying young, of course. But thankfully, history tells of another kind of martyr: those willing to sacrifice not their *lives*, but their *lifetimes*. So are you ready to sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime to advance the art form? Then apply to BYCombo!
