# The problem with indie rock

By the 90s, the major labels no longer invested in their bands. They simply counted on a few superstars to break out, like Nirvana and Radiohead, and then the rest were written off as lost bets. But the indie labels held to fair standards that promised *all* their bands a working future. A decade later, the majors imploded— so indie rock won! Except now…

Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com/essays/ongoing/band-mission-and-principles) here. I've spent half my life arguing that indie rock has made music *worse*, to no avail. But in recent years, something amazing has happened: Young people have grown disillusioned, and some now agree with me. It turns out, they'd *love* a Nirvana or Radiohead of their own. So the interdependence revolution can finally begin!

There's just one problem. Rebelling against centralized institutions is simple: Break all that we hate! But to rebel against a *de*-centralized system like indie rock, we must *build*— which is vastly more difficult. After all, build… what, exactly? Luckily, I've also spent half my life coming up with a plan:

**BYCombo will assemble interdependent bands who'll sacrifice serious chunks of lifetime to make historically consequential demos, which we'll then show in a public registry to sustain an alternative counterculture.**

### The revolution will *not* be decentralized

Okay, that's a mouthful! Let's break it down…

**Why an alternative counterculture?**

A counterculture is needed to protect dangerous ideas, yet we haven't had one for some time. Meanwhile, despite indie rock's good intentions, rock has gotten worse. But what if rock is worse… *because* of these good intentions? What if all this charitable support for indie *artists*… is actually bad for *art*? It's a dangerous idea, yet it might be rock's only hope— so let's protect it.

**Why historical consequence?**

Critical acclaim can be inflated, which makes it a terrible barometer. What *can't* be hacked is the [historical canon](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446), because making history means competing on equal terms with past artists who *didn't* rely on charitable support. In this light, it's likely that *no* indie artist today will be inducted into the canon— and *this* is why people gripe that rock is getting worse.

**Why assembled bands?**

Has rock explored all the ways a band can come together? It might seem so— assuming they'll always form on their own, in a decentralized free-for-all. But if we ditch this notion? Then rock has barely scratched the surface.

What if musicians hoping to form history-making bands could flock to a single hub from across the globe? What if a cartoonist could also join— and bands, in turn, could think to look for one? Or, suppose the next Kurt Cobain or Thom Yorke is a woman or minority who's currently struggling to attract bandmates. What if they could ask to be judged without unconscious bias?

With so many ways left to innovate in this space, there most certainly *are* canonical bands still to come. All that's needed is a centralized initiative like BYCombo to help them come together.

**Why interdependence?**

To make consequential art, a band must develop exceptional strengths. But this isn't humanly possible unless they're allowed to stay weak in areas of administration like marketing and distribution, where a *partner* can be more efficient. That is to say, history-making bands need to be *inter*-dependent, not *indie*-pendent. They *need* a label, or some other business partner.

**Why demos?**

A demo shows what a work can be in the *future*, with a partner's help. This doesn't just free a band to take creative risks; it awakens the very thought to do so— with [doublespeaker rhyme](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/4-odin/?annotation=7) being my own go-to example. Yes, artists today can self-release their works— but this is a *curse*, not a *blessing*. Past artists put out *demos*, and to compete with them means doing likewise.

**Why a public registry?**

It takes time to review an ambitious demo— but the indie labels won't put in this effort, since *any* artist they sign will be charitably supported just the same. So an interdependent band's best bet is to join a counterculture that *criticizes* indie rock's good intentions— and a public registry is where discerning fans and potential partners will know to find them.

**Why serious chunks of lifetime?**

Low barriers to entry have allowed an endless stream of underwhelming artists to pour through, leading people to grow wary and lose interest. But indie rock has no way to reverse this damage, given its decentralized nature.

To save rock, then, a centralized initiative like BYCombo must now step up to enforce a steep *cost* of entry. This cost can't be arbitrary or artificial, so it can only be one thing: a serious chunk of lifetime. After all, a lifetime is all you have; once that chunk is gone, it's *gone*! Which means there's nothing more precious that a band can sacrifice to restore the public's faith.

**And finally… how has indie rock made music worse?**

Here's an incomplete list of ways…

### The opportunity cost is too damn high

In the past, we of the English-speaking world rightfully claimed ours to be *the* rock canon. Our bands had no foreign peers; any who *could* match us, like ABBA, simply joined us instead. But today, indie rock is just another foreign canon, because indie artists *never* go above and beyond. Why don't they? It's because they're required to build a fanbase on their own.

Happily enough, building a fanbase yields compounded returns, since each fan brings in more fans. But not only that, with no talent scouts out there trying to discover artists, it's a huge disadvantage *not* to. Going above and beyond, on the other hand, yields *marginal* returns for *massive* effort— yet, by definition, it *isn't* a disadvantage simply *not* to!

What happens if a band goes above and beyond anyway, hoping to remain peerless? Add up their gains, subtract the costs, and the math is clear: They'll end up the biggest loser. No wonder we lost the canon! But with BYCombo, you can now go above and beyond to win it back.

### Revelations require a single hat

Indie rock requires artists to wear several hats: the influencer hat, the publicist hat… Of course, the best among them *don't* skimp on wearing the artist hat; they want their art to stay on par with their talents. Yet the best works are even *better* than the artists who make them. Why? Because they *also* benefit from insightful revelations that can't be summoned at will.

These revelations emerge from the unconscious mind as your thoughts drift in the shower, or when you daydream out of boredom— but this won't ever happen if you're always context switching. So keep your artist hat on. *You* want your art to be better than you, and so does BYCombo.

### The grassroots is now a lottery

The 80s indie bands are respected for having built a grassroots fanbase, right? Yes, but also for a less spoken reason: Their stories feel deterministic. That is to say, these bands were *always* likely to succeed, because they *earned* it. They put in the work each day for untold years— unlike a one-hit wonder, who simply lucked out and won the virtual lottery.

In those days, lottery players had no patience for the grassroots; they'd sign lopsided deals with a label instead, all for a single chance at exposure. But the Internet has empowered them to reach the people directly, giving them unlimited chances— *and* making them indie artists in good faith! So now they're drowning the world in their music— *and* getting respect for it.

Naturally, bands who prefer the deterministic path can't compete like this. Yet the indie gatekeepers don't sympathize; after all, *some* indie artists are doing just fine, as always! Thankfully, with BYCombo, you can once again *earn* your success, by showing up to work every day for untold years.

### History wants radio-friendly hooks

As a child, I studied the bands whose compositions I envied, and I dreamt that someday my own band could teach others. So a while back, I sent copies of my book [*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com) to all the indie labels; I later did the same with my tile game *[Bobtail Dominoes](https://www.bobtaildominoes.com)*. But the labels weren't interested… and now I know why: Indie rock has no conception of music as a *craft*.

To vie for radio airplay in the 90s, alternative bands would craft solid hooks that can be enjoyed [on their *own*](https://youtu.be/yjJL9DGU7Gg?t=36)— the kind of feat that other musicians envy. The indie labels always lost such bands to the majors, though, so instead they listened for works that rely on [*extrinsic* context](https://youtu.be/1VVj1zqbWpU) to be appreciated. And these works are loved most by *critics*, who provide this context to the public.

But even today with radio dying, the indie labels *still* aren't signing the next Nirvana or Radiohead, despite such bands now being theirs for the taking. Why? Because they still don't have an ear for it. So to this day, an acclaimed indie artist is one whom many critics admire, but few musicians envy.

Yet no one cares what past critics thought, while nearly everyone loves a past work with well-crafted hooks— and future generations will judge the music of *our* times the same way. Let's face it, making history starts with being the envy of other *musicians*. And BYCombo can help you make that happen.

### Creativity gets its chance from the *clueless*

Because the indie labels stay close to the local scenes, they're both "in the know" and "one of us." So whatever *they* like is the best of what *we'll* like, right? Yet according to studies… it's human nature to [*dis*-like creativity](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/16/science/creativity-implicit-bias.html)!

Creative ideas are unfamiliar, and this makes us uncomfortable. Now, the corporate suits just ignore this discomfort, since it's *all* unfamiliar to them. But those in the know pride themselves on their hard-won instincts, so they interpret the discomfort as a sincere warning from their gut. Ironically, then, as [Frank Zappa noted](https://youtu.be/xP4wsURn3rw), this makes them *worse* at discovering creativity!

Which is why history's most creative artists were often backed by those with no prior experience in the arts. Now with BYCombo, you can once again find business partners who *don't* take pride in knowing what great art looks like.

### Middle managers join the revolution *last*

In his book [*Originals*](https://adamgrant.net/book/originals), Adam Grant points out that in any business hierarchy, the ones most eager to take risks are those safely perched at the top, as well as those at the bottom with nothing to lose. Those in the middle, by contrast, are the most risk averse. And who are these risk-averse middle managers in *rock*? The indie labels.

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Just one final review now.

Because indie labels have just enough standing to lose, they only make *safe* bets. And the safest bet is to deliver what the [people already want](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/988332). But this creates an echo chamber— the same kind that makes predictive analytics so detrimental to art. Even worse, every revolution gets nipped in the bud, because the people *never* ask for revolutionary change on their own.

Revolutions may *start* with artists, but they're *spread* by business partners, whose know-how is needed to win over the public. This makes it crucial for such artists to find partners who share their appetite for risk. So BYCombo helps you reach industry executives who are well-funded enough to make *smart* bets, as well as budding entrepreneurs with no standing to lose.

### Competitive self-reliance favors privilege

To promote self-reliance, indie rock requires artists to do the middleman's job for themselves. But a wealthy artist can just pay *others* to do it… and, well, who better to hire than a former middleman?! So indie rock has done little more than "privatize" access to business deals that were once "public"— to the benefit of the privileged. How did this happen?

The problem is that indie rock enjoys the goodwill generated by artistic movements of *cooperative* self-reliance, like the Maker Faire, that are united by love of the *craft*. But indie rock is really about *competitive* self-reliance, like libertarianism in politics; it's grounded in excitement for the *hustle*. And nothing makes the hustle easier— and thus more exciting— than privilege.

There's nothing wrong with indie rock's artistic libertarianism— but it's a *partisan* ideal that gets mistaken as *universal*. So when a band struggles to hustle because it's a poor fit for their circumstances, they're told to just suck it up and try harder. Now with BYCombo, there's an opposition party that advocates for the interdependence you want, out of respect for your craft.

### *For* hungry outsiders, *by* a hungry outsider

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Just needs one more final review.
`}

Who foresaw indie rock's final stage as a trust fund playground? We did— us women and minorities— which is why *we've* never founded a movement to compete on self-reliance. By the way, don't be misled by hip hop's bravado: When rappers boast of having hustled, they're saying, "Hey, I hustled *too*." It's to *prevent* self-reliance alone from having any worth.

And since indie rock is an ideology, it must *always* favor the self-reliant, as its White male founders wanted— even if it comes to realize later on that few *else* want this. So don't be fooled by its recent upsurge in artist diversity; there can be no outreach, and there *hasn't* been one. All that's happened is… Hey, some women and minorities have trust funds *too*.

Why is indie rock handing over the reins to us only *now*, though? For the same reason a Fortune 500 company would: Because it's in *decline*. With little of historical consequence to show after two decades, indie rock has been demoted to just another foreign canon. So we women and minorities are being set up to [take the fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_cliff)…

No thanks! The best movements *for* us are the ones founded *by* us, to fit *our* circumstances. They offer what *we* want: *mutual* reliance, and a chance at the *historical* canon— in exchange for what *can't* be bought: originality and talent, born from an outsider's hunger. Hip hop was the *last* case in point, and BYCombo will be the *next*.

### Independence breeds homogeneity

Every time I've engaged with an indie gatekeeper, they've drawn the same conclusion: Yes, my projects are impressive, but I'm just a hobbyist; I'll eventually give up. I was stumped for so long. Why do they misjudge my nature so badly? And then it hit me: I *haven't* been rejected by a hundred gatekeepers. I've been rejected by the *same* gatekeeper, a hundred times over.

It's not just because indie rock was founded by society's ingroup, who are privileged enough to lack ambition and not have this affect their survival, who have the least incentive to understand that others think differently from them.

Interdependence itself is what you would choose to be great
The nature of independence itself instead of interdependence, is motivated by lack of ambition to be great, and then promotes an inability to understand that others think differently.

And so indie rock's gatekeepers select for themselves.

### A artists help A artists, B artists help C artists

For many years, I worked days as a coder and nights on my audio webcomic. When I came back to the music world, I was surprised to hear indie artists speak of paying their dues— to justify, let's say, touring at a loss. In the tech world, "paid dues" is a synonym for "fake work"— and outsiders who see this, disrupt industries that don't. But why *don't* the disrupted ever see this?

It's because paid dues are worthless outside the one system that promises to honor them. So those who pay them will fight to keep the system as it is. In short, you can pay your dues, or you can start a revolution— but never both.

Moreover, once someone has wasted their best years racking up symbolic credentials rather than actual talents, they can never feel secure enough to let others surpass them. As a result, the only newcomers they'll accept are the ones willing to squander even *more* potential. But these newcomers will then feel even *less* secure— thus perpetuating a vicious circle.

Which is why it took an outsider like myself to found BYCombo, driven by an urge to help up-and-coming bands surpass me. My solution is so simple, I doubt I'm the first to think of it. Rather, I'm just the first artist who's secure enough to *want* it— having never paid indie rock's dues myself.

### Art needs the blood of martyrs

"Where's *our* Nirvana?" It's a question asked by today's young people. Well, there's an easy way to answer it: Can we imagine the *next* generation asking of any band today, "Where's *our* _____?" If so, then _____ is this generation's Nirvana. Of course, we can't— because this generation never got its Nirvana. Why is that?

It's because we really only pine for past artists who self-sacrificed for art's sake. But indie rock is here to *save* artists from exploitation, and so it roots for those who *empower* themselves instead. As such, today's indie artists demand to be fairly compensated; they don't self-sacrifice for *anyone*, because to do so is a classic sign of being exploited.

But the problems with this current Age of Empowerment go beyond its failure to give us the next Nirvana. For one, self-empowerment is really just self-serving, power-seeking behavior in those we see as underdogs; it's not noble in and of itself. For another, in a decentralized system, artists with this trait hold the *advantage*— so how exactly are *they* the underdogs?

Worst of all, self-empowered artists will never *start* a revolution, because the means to fair compensation get settled only at the *end*. To save rock, then, we need to make way for selfless bands who'll sacrifice themselves for art's sake. After Empowerment, in other words… comes the Age of Martyrdom.

Let's never go back to the days of artists dying young, of course. Thankfully, history tells of another kind of martyr: those who sacrificed not their *lives*, but their *lifetimes*. What if this generation's Nirvana is an entire *movement* of selfless bands, each one sacrificing a serious chunk of lifetime to advance the art form?

Luckily, you don't need to ask, "Where's our BYCombo?" BYCombo is here for you *now*!
