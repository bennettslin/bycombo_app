# The problem with indie rock

Hi, Bennett here! I've spent half my life arguing that indie rock has made music worse, to no avail. But in recent years, something amazing has happened: Young people have started to agree with me. Which means the interdependence revolution can now begin!

There's just one problem: Indie rock isn't so much a genre as it is a system of rule. How do we revolt, when systems prevent revolution by design? Luckily, I've spent half my life contemplating this as well: BYCombo will assemble interdependent bands committed to making historically consequential demos, and then serve as a trusted registry of their works.

### The next revolution will be centralized

Why historical consequence? Because when people say that rock music has gotten worse, this is what they have in mind. Yes, talent is still out there, but it's no longer enough. For the foreseeable future, making art that matters to history will require massive effort. And only a centralized initiative like BYCombo can light this fire in today's artists.

Why assembled bands? Because there are revolutionary acts still to come; they're just unlikely to come together on their own now. How do five musicians committed to making history find each other across the globe? How does a comic book artist join as a full-fledged member? Untested ensembles also need a centralized initiative to make them happen.

Why interdependence and demos? Because to make consequential art, a band needs to build exceptional strengths. But this isn't humanly possible unless they stay weak in areas that a label will later cover. Which is to say, consequential art *needs* to be interdependent; it *needs* to partner with a label. And demos are what a band sounds like before they've found theirs.

Why a trusted registry? Because art that requires massive effort to *make* also takes more effort to *understand*— and the indie gatekeepers are too harried for this task. But bands who defy the gatekeepers are the ones who make history! Through a trusted registry, the world can bypass the gatekeepers and discover these bands directly.

Why *else* is indie rock so ill-suited to these times? Here are a few more reasons…

### Serendipity favors a single hat

Indie rock requires artists to wear several hats: the influencer hat, the publicist hat… of course, the best among them don't skimp on wearing the artist hat. They want their art to stay on par with their level of talent.

But the best works of art are *better* than the artists who make them. Why? Because they also benefit from so many eureka moments that can't be summoned at will. And such moments emerge from unconscious thoughts that get disrupted by switching hats. This is why BYCombo lets you keep the artist hat on. You want your art to be better than you, and so do we.

### Middling power leads to risk aversion

In his book *Originals*, Adam Grant points out that in any hierarchy, the ones eager to take risks are those at the bottom with nothing to lose, and those safely perched at the top. By contrast, those in the middle are the most risk averse. This might explain why indie rock is so unoriginal. Its artists seek power while its labels relinquish it, which results in *no one* taking risks.

Because indie artists strive for power from the get-go, they're immediately beholden to the current paradigm that empowers them. And then they never learn to question *any* paradigm. For this reason, BYCombo encourages bands to treat their powerless years as a creative asset: While you have nothing to lose, what paradigms are you free to challenge?

### The masses are *last* to join the revolution

Meanwhile, because indie labels *lack* power, they only make safe bets. And the safest bet is to give the masses what they already want. But this creates an echo chamber, the same kind that makes streaming algorithms so detrimental to art. Even worse, it means the world is stuck with the current paradigm, because the masses *never* ask for paradigm change on their own.

Revolutions that challenge the current paradigm may *start* with powerless outsiders, but they're *popularized* by powerful insiders. Far from exploiting such movements, those at the very top play a crucial role in getting buy-in from the masses. This may not jibe with indie rock's anti-establishment fantasy, but it's the historical truth. So BYCombo works with it.

### Responsible revolutions plan for runaway effects

Indie rock is a culture of self-reliance that gives artists the tools needed to bypass the middleman. But if the middleman's job is simple enough for artists to do themselves, then any wealthy artist can just pay *others* to do it. As a result, indie rock has devolved into a trust fund playground, leading to today's disillusionment. Yet this was foreseeable from day one!

Will BYCombo also devolve? Well, a band taking our approach to its absurd conclusion might spend an *entire* lifetime on their demo. But if anything, doing this practically *guarantees* that you'll be remembered by history!

### *For* hungry outsiders, *by* a hungry outsider

Who foresaw indie rock's absurd conclusion? Minorities did— which is why they've never founded a culture that rewards self-reliance. Instead, their movements value what can't be bought: talent and originality born from hunger. And BYCombo is the latest case in point.

Don't be fooled by indie rock's recent embrace of female and minority artists: They've been handed the reins *because* it's in decline. These are crumbs on offer here. Meanwhile, BYCombo was *conceived* to serve all those who face disadvantages in life. We know that disadvantage drives your desire for *mutual* reliance, as well as your hunger to aim for the *top* of the pantheon.

### Art needs the blood of martyrs

Indie rock is all about fair compensation: Artists must never give more of themselves than they take. Not even voluntarily, since this is a slippery slope that leads to further expectations of sacrifice all around. As such, indie rock has never given the world a rock and roll martyr— and proudly so.

Yet rock *needs* martyrs, because the farthest heights and ends of the art form can only be reached at great personal cost. Let's never go back to the days of artists dying young, of course. But thankfully, history tells of another kind of martyr: those willing to sacrifice not their *lives*, but their *lifetimes*.

Are you willing to be a martyr, and sacrifice a chunk of lifetime to the betterment of rock music? Then BYCombo is here for you!
