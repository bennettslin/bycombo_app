# The problem with indie rock

Bennett here! I've spent half my life arguing that indie rock has made music worse, to no avail. But in recent years, something amazing has happened: Young people have grown disillusioned, and some now agree with me. Which means the interdependence revolution can finally begin!

There's just one problem: Indie rock isn't really a *genre*, so much as it's a *system* of rule. How do we revolt, when systems prevent revolution by design? Luckily, I've spent half my life figuring this out as well:

**Through BYCombo, we'll assemble interdependent bands committed to sacrificing serious chunks of lifetime to make historically consequential demos. We'll then store these demos in a public registry.**

### The revolution will *not* be decentralized

**Why historical consequence?**

Because when people gripe about rock music getting worse, they're *really* griping that history is no longer being made. Yes, talent is still out there— but competing with the past now calls for explicit intent and massive effort. And only a centralized force like BYCombo can light this fire in today's artists.

**Why band assembly?**

Because there *are* revolutionary bands still to come; they're just unlikely to come together on their own now. How do five musicians committed to making history find each other across the globe? How does an illustrator join as a full-fledged member? A centralized force is also needed to experiment with new musical ensembles.

**Why interdependence? Why demos?**

To make consequential art, a band needs to build exceptional strengths. But this isn't humanly possible unless they stay weak in areas that a label will later cover. Which is to say, history makers need to be *inter*-dependent, not *indie*-pendent; they *need* to partner with a label. And demos are what a band sounds like while they're still unsigned.

**Why a public registry?**

Because art that requires massive effort to *make* also takes more effort to *understand*— and the indie gatekeepers aren't up for this task. But bands who defy the gatekeepers' expectations are the ones who make history! So our registry allows the public to discover these bands directly.

**Why serious chunks of lifetime?**

Because a lifetime is all you have, and it's fixed. Once that chunk is gone, it's *gone*. Which means there's nothing of greater value that a band can sacrifice to gain the public's trust. And going forward, time spent making art is likely the best predictor of artistic worth. So if a band *must* be reduced to a single number, then this *should* be the one they want.

Why *else* is indie rock so ill-suited to these times? A few more reasons…

### Serendipity favors a single hat

Indie rock requires artists to wear several hats: the influencer hat, the publicist hat… of course, the best among them don't skimp on wearing the artist hat. They want their art to stay on par with their level of talent.

But the best works of art are *better* than the artists who make them. Why? Because they also benefit from so many eureka moments that can't be summoned at will. And such moments emerge from unconscious thoughts that get disrupted by switching hats. This is why BYCombo lets you keep the artist hat on. You want your art to be better than you, and so do we.

### Middling power leads to risk aversion

In his book *Originals*, Adam Grant points out that in any hierarchy, the ones eager to take risks are those at the bottom with nothing to lose, and those safely perched at the top. By contrast, those in the middle are the most risk averse. This might explain why indie rock is so unoriginal. Its artists seek power while its labels relinquish it, which results in *no one* taking risks.

Because indie artists strive for power from the get-go, they're immediately beholden to the current paradigm that empowers them. And then they never learn to question *any* paradigm. For this reason, BYCombo encourages bands to treat their powerless years as a creative asset: While you have nothing to lose, what paradigms are you free to question?

### The masses are *last* to join the revolution

Meanwhile, because indie labels *lack* power, they only make safe bets. And the safest bet is to give the masses what they already want. But this creates an echo chamber— the same kind that makes streaming algorithms so detrimental to art. Even worse, it means the world is stuck with the current paradigm, because the masses *never* ask for paradigm change on their own.

Revolutions that challenge the current paradigm may *start* with powerless outsiders, but they're *popularized* by powerful insiders. Far from exploiting such movements, those at the very top play a crucial role in getting buy-in from the masses. This may not jibe with indie rock's anti-establishment fantasy, but it's the historical truth. So BYCombo gladly works with powerful insiders, for the sake of our revolutionary bands.

### Responsible revolutions plan for runaway effects

Indie rock is a culture of self-reliance that celebrates artists who bypass the middleman. But if the middleman's job is simple enough for artists to do themselves, then any wealthy artist can just pay *others* to do it. As a result, indie rock has devolved into a trust fund playground, leading to today's disillusionment. Yet this was foreseeable from day one!

Won't BYCombo see a runaway effect as well? Yes, but ours is foreseeably a race to the *top*. Taking our mission to its absurd conclusion, a band might spend an *entire* lifetime on their demo— which pretty much *guarantees* they'll be remembered by history!

### *For* hungry outsiders, *by* a hungry outsider

Who foresaw indie rock's absurd conclusion? Minorities did— which is why they've never founded a culture that rewards self-reliance. Instead, their movements value what can't be bought: talent and originality born from hunger. And BYCombo is the latest case in point.

Don't be fooled by indie rock's recent embrace of female and minority artists: They've been handed the reins *because* it's in decline. These are crumbs on offer here. Meanwhile, BYCombo was *conceived* to serve all those who face disadvantages in life. We know that disadvantage drives your desire for *mutual* reliance, as well as your hunger to aim for the *top* of the pantheon.

### Art needs the blood of martyrs

Indie rock is all about fair compensation: Artists must never give more of themselves than they take. Not even voluntarily, since this is a slippery slope that leads to further expectations of sacrifice all around. As such, indie rock has never given the world a rock martyr— and proudly so.

Yet rock *needs* martyrs, because the farthest heights and ends of the art form can only be reached at great personal cost. Let's never go back to the days of artists dying young, of course. But thankfully, history tells of another kind of martyr: those willing to sacrifice not their *lives*, but their *lifetimes*.

How about you? Are you willing to sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime to advance the art form? If so, then apply to BYCombo!
