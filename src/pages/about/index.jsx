# The problem with indie rock

Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com) here! I've spent half my life arguing that indie rock has made rock worse, to no avail. But in recent years, something amazing has happened: Young people are disillusioned, and some now agree with me. Which means the interdependence revolution can finally begin!

There's just one problem: Indie rock isn't really a *genre* so much as it's a *system*. How do we revolt, when every system preserves a status quo by design? Luckily, I've spent half my life figuring this out as well:

**BYCombo will assemble interdependent bands who'll sacrifice serious chunks of lifetime to make historically consequential demos, which we'll then store in a public registry to sustain an anti-indie counterculture.**

### The revolution will *not* be decentralized

**Why an anti-indie counterculture?**

A counterculture is needed to protect dangerous ideas, yet there hasn't been one for a while. Meanwhile, despite indie rock's good intentions, rock has gotten worse. But what if rock is worse… *because* of these good intentions? What if all this charitable support for indie *artists*… is actually bad for *art*? It's a dangerous idea, yet it might be rock's only hope— so let's protect it.

**Why historical consequence?**

Critical acclaim can be inflated; as such, it's a terrible barometer. What *can't* be hacked is the historical canon, because making history means competing on equal terms with past artists who *didn't* rely on charitable support. In this light, it's likely that *no* indie artist today will be inducted— and *this* is why people gripe that rock is getting worse.

**Why assembled bands?**

Has rock fully explored all the ways a band can come together? It might seem so. Ditch the notion that they must come together on their *own*, however, and it's clear that rock has only scratched the surface.

What if musicians committed to making history could instantly find each other across the globe? What if a cartoonist or a dancer could readily join as a full-fledged member? With so many ways left to innovate in this space, there most certainly *are* canonical bands still to come. All that's needed is a centralized force like BYCombo to help them come together.

**Why interdependence?**

To make consequential art, a band must develop exceptional strengths. But this isn't humanly possible unless they're allowed to stay weak in areas where a *label* is more efficient, such as marketing and distribution. That is to say, history-making bands need to be *inter*-dependent, not *indie*-pendent. They *need* to partner with a label.

**Why demos?**

A demo shows what a work can be in the *future*, with the help of a label. This doesn't just free a band to aim high and take creative risks; it awakens the very thought to do so— [doublespeaker rhyme](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/4-odin/?annotation=7) being my go-to example. Yes, artists today can self-release their works— but this is a *curse*, not a *blessing*. Past artists made *demos*, and competing with them means doing likewise.

**Why a public registry?**

It takes time to review an ambitious demo— but the indie gatekeepers refuse to put in this effort, knowing that *any* artist they choose will be charitably supported just the same. So an interdependent band's only hope is to appeal to a counterculture that *rejects* indie rock's good intentions— and a public registry is where they'll find each other.

**Why serious chunks of lifetime?**

Low barriers to entry have allowed an endless stream of underwhelming artists to pour through, leading the public to grow wary and lose interest. But indie rock has no way to reverse this damage, given its decentralized nature.

To save rock, then, a centralized force like BYCombo must now step up to enforce a steep *cost* of entry. The cost can't be arbitrary or artificial, so it can only be one thing: a serious chunk of lifetime. After all, a lifetime is all you have; once that chunk is gone, it's *gone*! Which means there's nothing more precious that a band can sacrifice to earn the public's trust.

**Why has indie rock made rock worse?**

Here's an incomplete list of reasons…

${'  ' || `
### Art needs an opposition party

Political conservatives want socioeconomic *indie*-pendence. Which is fine, since no one mistakes this for a universal ideal. Liberals, their opponents, would rather have *inter*-dependence. And so we hold elections to promote healthy competition, as each of us decides which side speaks more to our circumstances.

Indie rock is clearly the conservative party of rock— yet its ideals are treated as universal, *not* partisan! So when bands struggle to be indie because it's a poor fit for their circumstances, they're just told to suck it up and try harder. With BYCombo, you can now join the opposition, which advocates for the interdependence you've always wanted but didn't know was possible.

### History remembers hooks

A while back, I sent manuscripts of my songwriting book [*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com) to all the indie labels. None were interested… and I soon figured out why. It takes time to compose a strong melody and chord progression, no less than it does to build a fanbase— and indie rock prioritizes the latter. As such, its aesthetic is proudly *defined* by a lack of widespread appeal.

Yet few of us care that a past artist built a fanbase on their own, while nearly everyone loves a past work with well-crafted hooks— and future generations will surely feel the same. There's no way around it: Making history starts with crafting your best hooks. Which is why BYCombo gives you all the time you need.

### Insightful revelation requires a single hat

Indie rock requires its artists to wear several hats: the influencer hat, the publicist hat… of course, the best among them don't skimp on wearing the artist hat. They want their art to stay on par with their talent. Yet the best works of art are even *better* than the artists who make them. Why?

Because they *also* benefit from revelatory insights that stem from the unconscious and can't be summoned at will. These insights emerge when your thoughts drift in the shower, or you daydream out of boredom— but this won't happen if you're always context switching. So keep your artist hat on. You want your art to be better than you, and so does BYCombo.

### A pittance secures loyalty to the paradigm

In his book [*Originals*](https://adamgrant.net/book/originals), Adam Grant points out that in any hierarchy, the ones eager to take risks are those at the bottom with nothing to lose, and those safely perched at the top. By contrast, those in the middle are the most risk averse. This might explain why indie rock is so unoriginal: Indie artists seek power while indie labels relinquish it, with *no one* taking any risks.

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Make these more about getting paid, less about power? This change may not be needed if paid dues is more about misinformation.
`}

Because indie artists strive to get paid from the get-go, they can never rebel against the current paradigm, which promises to empower them. For this reason, BYCombo encourages bands to embrace being powerless and unpaid early on: While you have nothing to lose, what revolutions are you free to start?

### Masses join revolutions *last*

Meanwhile, because indie labels *lack* power, they only make safe bets. And the safest bet is to give the masses what they already want. But this creates an echo chamber— the same kind that makes streaming algorithms so detrimental to art. Even worse, every revolution will be nipped in the bud, because the masses have *never* accepted a paradigm change on their own.

Revolutions may *start* with powerless outsiders, but they're *spread* by powerful insiders. Far from exploiting such movements, those at the very top play a crucial role in getting buy-in from the masses. While this may not jibe with indie rock's anti-establishment fantasy, it's the historical truth. So BYCombo is happy to see its bands partner with powerful insiders.

### Responsible revolutions plan for runaway effects

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Split this in two. Make one about paid dues, the hustle, possibly hip hop. Paid dues now collude. But how does it differ from the pittance section? Make it more about misinformation. Make the other about runaway effects of a culture that celebrates self-reliance amounting to privilege.
`}

Indie rock is all about rewarding artists who bypass the middleman. But if the middleman's job is simple enough for any artist to do themselves, then a wealthy artist can just pay someone *else* to do it— including, ironically, a former middleman! And so indie rock has become a trust fund playground, leading to today's disillusionment. Yet this was foreseeable from day one!

Won't interdependence see a runaway effect as well? Yes, but it's foreseeably a race to the *top*. Taking BYCombo's approach to its absurd conclusion, a band might spend an *entire* lifetime on their demo— but this basically *guarantees* they'll be remembered by history!

### *For* hungry outsiders, *by* a hungry outsider

Who foresaw indie rock's ironic endgame? Minorities did— which is why they've never founded a culture that rewards self-reliance. Instead, their movements value what can't be bought: originality and talent born from an outsider's hunger. And BYCombo is the latest case in point.

Don't be fooled by indie rock's recent embrace of female and minority artists. They've been handed the reins *because* it's in decline; these are crumbs on offer here. Meanwhile, BYCombo was *conceived* to serve disadvantaged groups. I know firsthand that disadvantage drives your instinct for *mutual* reliance, as well as your hunger to aim for the *top* of the pantheon.

### Art needs the blood of martyrs

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Finish updating this section.

Givers and takers.

Indie rock celebrates the self-empowered— but self-empowerment is just self-serving, power-seeking behavior in artists we like; it's not inherently noble. Moreover, in a decentralized system, those with this trait hold the *advantage*— which calls into question whether they're the actual underdogs here.

But worst of all, indie artists will never start a revolution, because early pioneers only forge pathways to power for *others*— they don't empower themselves. So if the art form is ever to advance again, we *need* to clear a path for selfless bands who are willing to make this sacrifice. In other words, after self-empowerment… comes the age of martyrdom.

Indie rock celebrates the self-empowered— but self-empowerment is just self-serving, power-seeking behavior in those we like; it's not inherently noble. On top of that, it means we're effectively rooting against the *selfless*— who start at a disadvantage to begin with.

This is a problem, because indie artists, whose main concern is to serve themselves, will never take rock to new heights; the personal costs are too great for them. So if the art form is ever to advance again, we *need* to clear a path for the selfless bands who *will* make this sacrifice. In other words, after self-empowerment… comes the age of martyrdom.

Let's never go back to the days of musicians dying young, of course. But thankfully, history tells of another kind of martyr: those willing to sacrifice not their *lives*, but their *lifetimes*. So are you ready to sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime to advance the art form? Then apply to BYCombo!
