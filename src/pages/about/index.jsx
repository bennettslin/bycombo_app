# The problem with indie rock

Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com) here! I've spent half my life arguing that indie rock has made music worse, to no avail. But in recent years, something amazing has happened: Young people are disillusioned, and some now agree with me. Which means the interdependence revolution can finally begin!

There's just one problem: Indie rock isn't really a *genre* so much as it's a *system*. How do we revolt, when every system protects a status quo by design? Luckily, I've spent half my life figuring this out as well:

**BYCombo will assemble interdependent bands who'll sacrifice serious chunks of lifetime to make historically consequential demos, which we'll then store in a public registry to sustain an anti-indie counterculture.**

### The revolution will *not* be decentralized

**Why an anti-indie counterculture?**

Countercultures are needed to protect dangerous ideas, and there hasn't been a counterculture for a while. Meanwhile, even as indie rock has made music worse, we've all adopted its good intentions. But… what if rock has gotten worse *because* of all our well-intentioned support for indie artists? This is a dangerous idea, yet it might be rock's only hope— so let's protect it.

**Why historical consequence?**

Critical acclaim can be inflated, which makes it worthless. What can *never* be hacked is the historical canon, because making history means competing on equal terms with past artists who *didn't* benefit from charitable support. In this light, it's likely that no indie artist today will be inducted— and *this* is why people gripe that rock is getting worse.

**Why assembled bands?**

But there *are* history-making bands to come; they're just unlikely to come together on their *own*. How do four musicians committed to advancing the art form find each other across the globe? How does a cartoonist or a dancer join as a full-fledged member? A centralized force like BYCombo is needed to reimagine what a rock band in the 21st century can *be*.

**Why interdependence?**

To make historically consequential art, a band has to develop exceptional strengths. But this isn't humanly possible unless they stay weak in other areas. They *must* hold off on the administrative tasks that a label will later cover far more efficiently. That is to say, history-making bands need to be *inter*-dependent, not *indie*-pendent. They *need* to partner with a label.

**Why demos?**

Indie artists self-release their works, paving the way for others. But this is a curse, *not* a blessing. Past artists made *demos*— and competing with them likely involves doing the same. After all, a demo shows what a work can be in the *future*, with the help of a label. This doesn't just *free* a band to aim high and take creative risks; it awakens the very *thought* to do so.

(If you need a solid example, the idea for [doublespeaker rhyme](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/4-odin/?annotation=7) came to me only because I was making a demo to win over the labels.)

**Why a public registry?**

Ambitious demos take time to fairly evaluate. But the indie gatekeepers feel no need to put in this effort, because *any* artist they choose will be charitably supported. So an interdependent band's only hope is to appeal directly to a sympathetic counterculture that questions indie rock's ideals— and now they can, by adding their demo to BYCombo's registry.

**Why serious chunks of lifetime?**

By lowering the barriers to entry, indie rock exhausted the public's trust for *all* aspiring artists. And because the system is decentralized, this trend can't be reversed. What rock needs now, then, is a centralized force like BYCombo to enforce a steep *cost* of entry. The cost can't be arbitrary or artificial, so it can only be one thing: a serious chunk of lifetime.

After all, a lifetime is all you have; once that chunk is gone, it's *gone*! Which means there's nothing more precious that a band can sacrifice to earn the public's trust.

**Why has indie rock made music worse?**

Here's an incomplete list of reasons…

### Art needs an opposition party

Political conservatives want socioeconomic *indie*-pendence. Which is fine, since no one mistakes this for a universal ideal. Liberals, their opponents, would rather have *inter*-dependence. And so we hold elections to promote healthy competition, as each of us decides which side speaks more to our circumstances.

Indie rock is clearly the conservative party of rock— yet its ideals are treated as universal, *not* partisan! So when bands struggle to be indie because it's a poor fit for their circumstances, they're just told to suck it up and try harder. With BYCombo, you can now join the opposition, which advocates for the interdependence you've always wanted but didn't know was possible.

### History wants hooks, not hustles

A while back, I sent manuscripts of my songwriting book [*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com) to all the indie labels. None were interested… and I soon figured out why. It takes time to compose a strong melody and chord progression, no less than it does to build a fanbase— and indie rock prioritizes the latter. As such, its aesthetic is proudly *defined* by a lack of widespread appeal.

Yet few of us care that a past artist hustled to build a fanbase, while nearly everyone loves a past work with well-crafted hooks— and future generations will surely feel the same. There's no way around it: Making history starts with composing your best hooks. So BYCombo gives you all the time you need.

### Insightful revelation requires a single hat

Indie rock requires artists to wear several hats: the influencer hat, the publicist hat… of course, the best among them don't skimp on wearing the artist hat. They want their art to stay on par with their talent. Yet the best works of art are even *better* than the artists who make them. Why?

Because they *also* benefit from revelatory insights that stem from the unconscious and can't be summoned at will. These insights emerge when your thoughts drift in the shower, or you daydream out of boredom; but this won't happen if you're always context switching. So BYCombo lets you keep the artist hat on. You want your art to be *better* than you, and so do we.

### A pittance secures loyalty to the paradigm

In his book [*Originals*](https://adamgrant.net/book/originals), Adam Grant points out that in any hierarchy, the ones eager to take risks are those at the bottom with nothing to lose, and those safely perched at the top. By contrast, those in the middle are the most risk averse. This might explain why indie rock is so unoriginal. Its artists seek power while its labels relinquish it, with *no one* taking any risks.

Because indie artists strive to get paid from the get-go, they're instantly beholden to the current paradigm, which promises to empower them. For this reason, BYCombo encourages its bands to embrace being powerless and unpaid early on: While you have nothing to lose, what paradigms are you free to challenge?

### Masses join revolutions *last*

Meanwhile, because indie labels *lack* power, they only make safe bets. And the safest bet is to give the masses what they already want. But this creates an echo chamber— the same kind that makes streaming algorithms so detrimental to art. Even worse, every revolution will be nipped in the bud, because the masses have *never* accepted a paradigm change on their own.

Revolutions may *start* with powerless outsiders, but they're *spread* by powerful insiders. Far from exploiting such movements, those at the very top play a crucial role in getting buy-in from the masses. While this may not jibe with indie rock's anti-establishment fantasy, it's the historical truth. So BYCombo is happy to see its bands partner with powerful insiders.

### Responsible revolutions plan for runaway effects

Indie rock is all about rewarding artists who bypass the middleman. But if the middleman's job is simple enough for any artist to do themselves, then a wealthy artist can just pay someone *else* to do it— including, ironically, a former middleman! And so indie rock has become a trust fund playground, leading to today's disillusionment. Yet this was foreseeable from day one!

Won't interdependence see a runaway effect as well? Yes, but it's foreseeably a race to the *top*. Taking BYCombo's approach to its absurd conclusion, a band might spend an *entire* lifetime on their demo— but this basically *guarantees* they'll be remembered by history!

### *For* hungry outsiders, *by* a hungry outsider

Who foresaw indie rock's ironic endgame? Minorities did— which is why they've never founded a culture that rewards self-reliance. Instead, their movements value what can't be bought: originality and talent born from hunger. And BYCombo is the latest case in point.

Don't be fooled by indie rock's recent embrace of female and minority artists. They've been handed the reins *because* it's in decline; these are crumbs on offer here. Meanwhile, BYCombo was *conceived* to serve disadvantaged groups. I know firsthand that disadvantage drives your instinct for *mutual* reliance, as well as your hunger to aim for the *top* of the pantheon.

### Art needs the blood of martyrs

Indie rock celebrates the self-empowered— but self-empowerment is just self-serving, power-seeking behavior in those we like; it's not inherently noble. On top of that, it means we're effectively rooting *against* the selfless— who start at a disadvantage to begin with.

This is a problem, because indie artists, whose main concern is to serve themselves, will never take rock to new heights; the personal costs are too great for them. So if the art form is ever to advance again, we *need* to clear a path for the selfless bands who'll happily make this sacrifice. In other words, after self-empowerment… comes the age of martyrdom.

Let's never go back to the days of musicians dying young, of course. But thankfully, history tells of another kind of martyr: those willing to sacrifice not their *lives*, but their *lifetimes*. So are you ready to sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime to advance the art form? Then apply to BYCombo!
