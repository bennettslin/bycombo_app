# Why BYCombo?

Hi, I'm Bennett from the Bobtail Yearlings. I've spent half my life arguing that indie rock has made music worse, to no avail. But something amazing has happened in recent years: Young people have started to agree with me. Which means the interdependence revolution can begin!

There's just one problem: Indie rock isn't so much a genre as it is a system of rule. How can we revolt against a system, when systems prevent future revolution by design? Luckily, I've spent half my life figuring this out as well. BYCombo's solution is to assemble bands who are committed to making demos of historical consequence.

### Interdependence 101

Why historical consequence? Because when people say that music has gotten worse, this is really what they have in mind. Yes, good art is still being made, but history no longer cares by default. What's needed from today's artists is an explicit intent to last, and a massive effort to ensure it. And this will only happen through top-down initiatives like BYCombo.

Why demos? Because to make consequential art, a band needs to build exceptional strengths. But this isn't humanly possible unless they stay weak in areas that a label will later cover. Which is to say, consequential art can only happen interdependently. It needs to partner with a label, and demos are what a band sounds like until they've found one.

Why assembled bands? Because there are revolutionary bands still to come; they're just no longer likely to come together on their own. How do five musicians committed to making consequential art find each other across the globe? How does a comic book artist join as a full-fledged member? Unprecedented coalitions need top-down assembly, and BYCombo can help.

### Serendipity favors a single hat

Indie rock requires artists to wear multiple hats: the manager hat, the publicist hat… all of which take up precious time. Of course, the best indie artists don't skimp on wearing the artist hat, so their art is always as good as one should expect for their level of talent.

But the best works of art are *better* than the artists who make them. Why? Because such works also benefit from countless moments of serendipity that can't be repeated at will. And when serendipity strikes, its benefits go to whichever hat you're wearing. So if you only care to wear the artist hat, then BYCombo is here for you. You want your art to be better than you, and so do we.

### Middling power leads to risk aversion

In his book *Originals*, Adam Grant points out that in any hierarchy, the ones eager to take risks are those at the bottom with nothing to lose, and those safely perched at the top. By contrast, those in the middle are the most risk averse. This might explain why indie rock is so unoriginal. Its artists seek power while its labels relinquish it, so *no one* takes any risks.

Because indie artists strive for power from day one, they're immediately beholden to the current paradigm that empowers them. They then fail to develop an instinct for questioning *any* paradigm. So at BYCombo, we encourage bands to treat their powerless years as a creative asset. What paradigm is your art free to challenge, while you have no power to safeguard?

### The masses join the revolution last

Meanwhile, because indie labels *lack* power, they only make safe bets. And the safest bet is to give the masses what they already want. This creates an echo chamber, the same kind that makes streaming algorithms so detrimental to art. Even worse, it means the current paradigm can never change, because the masses *never* ask for paradigm change on their own.

Revolutions that challenge the current paradigm may *start* with powerless outsiders, but they're *popularized* by powerful insiders at the top. Far from just exploiting such movements, these insiders play a crucial role in getting buy-in from the masses. This may not jibe with anyone's anti-establishment fantasy, but it's the historical truth. So BYCombo doesn't fight this truth; we work with it.

### Responsible revolutions anticipate runaway effects

Indie rock gives artists the tools they need to bypass the middleman, and nothing more. But if the middleman's job is straightforward enough for artists to do themselves, then wealthy artists can just as easily pay *others* to do it. So indie rock devolved into a trust fund playground, leading to the disillusionment of today's young people. Yet this was the foreseeable endgame all along!

Will BYCombo devolve as well? I doubt it. Our solution, taken to its absurd conclusion, calls for spending insane chunks of lifetime while combining brazenly diverse mediums. But if anything, the bands who do this will likely end up making the most consequential works of the century.

### For hungry outsiders, by a hungry outsider

Who foresaw indie rock's absurd conclusion? Minorities did— which is why they've never started an indie movement. Instead, their movements reward what can't be bought: talent and originality born from hunger. And this is what BYCombo does.

Yes, indie rock has recently embraced female and minority artists. But don't be fooled: They've been handed the reins *because* it's in decline. These are crumbs being offered here. Worse, history may remember this belated influx of diversity as the *cause* of indie rock's demise. Meanwhile, BYCombo helps women and minorities aim for the *top* of rock music's pantheon.

### Art needs martyrs
