# The problem with indie rock

Bennett here! I've spent half my life arguing that indie rock has made music worse, to no avail. But in recent years, something amazing has happened: Young people have grown disillusioned, and some now agree with me. Which means the interdependence revolution can finally begin!

There's just one problem: Indie rock isn't really a *genre* so much as it's a *system*. How do we revolt, when systems prevent revolution by design? Luckily, I've spent half my life figuring this out as well:

**BYCombo will assemble interdependent bands who'll sacrifice serious chunks of lifetime to make historically consequential demos, which we'll then keep in our public registry to sustain an anti-indie counterculture.**

### The revolution will *not* be decentralized

**Why historical consequence?**

Because when people gripe about rock getting worse, they're *really* griping that history no longer gets made. Yes, talent is still out there— but competing with the past now calls for explicit intent and massive effort. And only a centralized force like BYCombo can light this fire in today's artists.

**Why assembled bands?**

Because there *are* revolutionary bands to come; they're just unlikely to come together on their *own* now. How do five musicians committed to making history find each other across the globe? How does an illustrator join as a full-fledged member? A centralized force is needed to explore new musical ensembles.

**Why interdependence? Why demos?**

To make consequential art, a band needs to build exceptional strengths. But this isn't humanly possible unless they stay weak in areas that a label will later cover. Which is to say, history makers need to be *inter*-dependent, not *indie*-pendent; they *need* to partner with a label. And demos are what a band sounds like until they've signed to one.

**Why a public registry?**

Because art that requires massive effort to *make* also takes more effort to *understand*— and the indie gatekeepers are too harried for this task. But bands who defy the gatekeepers' expectations are the ones who make history! So our registry allows the public to discover these bands directly.

**Why serious chunks of lifetime?**

Because a lifetime is all you have, and it's fixed. Once that chunk is gone, it's *gone*. Which means there's nothing of greater value that a band can sacrifice to gain the public's trust. And going forward, time spent making art is likely to be the best predictor of artistic worth. So if a band *must* be judged by a single metric, then this should be the one they want.

**Why an anti-indie counterculture?**

Countercultures provide a steady influx of radical ideas, yet there hasn't been one for a while now. Meanwhile, indie rock has made music worse, but its well-intended values are now the mainstream. So anti-indie agitators get plenty of grief— even though they're saving rock for *all* of us!— and we owe them the moral support of a sympathetic community.

Why *exactly* has indie rock made music worse? Here's an incomplete list of reasons…

### Art needs an opposition party

Political conservatives want socioeconomic *indie*-pendence. Which is fine— since no one mistakes this partisan belief for a universal one. Liberals, their opponents, would rather have *inter*-dependence. And each of us is free to decide which side speaks more to our circumstances.

Indie rock is clearly the conservative party of rock— yet its beliefs are seen as universal, *not* partisan! So when artists struggle to be indie because it's a poor fit for their circumstances, they're told to just suck it up and try harder. Now with BYCombo, they can join rock's liberal party, which advocates for the interdependence they've always wanted but didn't know was possible.

### Insightful revelation requires a single hat

Indie rock requires artists to wear several hats: the influencer hat, the publicist hat… of course, the best among them don't skimp on wearing the artist hat. They want their art to stay on par with their level of talent.

But the best works of art are *better* than the artists who make them. Why? Because they *also* benefit from countless revelatory insights that can't be summoned at will. These insights come from letting thoughts drift in the shower, or daydreaming out of boredom; they won't happen if you're always switching hats. So BYCombo lets you keep the artist hat on.

### A pittance secures loyalty to the paradigm

In his book [*Originals*](https://adamgrant.net/book/originals), Adam Grant points out that in any hierarchy, the ones eager to take risks are those at the bottom with nothing to lose, and those safely perched at the top. By contrast, those in the middle are the most risk averse. This might explain why indie rock is so unoriginal. Its artists seek power while its labels relinquish it, which results in *no one* taking risks.

Because indie artists strive to get paid from the get-go, they're quickly beholden to the current paradigm that empowers them. For this reason, BYCombo encourages our bands to embrace being powerless and unpaid early on: While you have nothing to lose, what revolutions are you free to start?

### The masses join the revolution *last*

Meanwhile, because indie labels *lack* power, they only make safe bets. And the safest bet is to give the masses what they already want. But this creates an echo chamber— the same kind that makes streaming algorithms so detrimental to art. Even worse, every revolution will be nipped in the bud, because the masses *never* accept paradigm changes on their own.

Revolutions may *start* with powerless outsiders, but they're *spread* by powerful insiders. Far from exploiting such movements, those at the very top play a crucial role in getting buy-in from the masses. While this may not jibe with indie rock's anti-establishment fantasy, it's the historical truth. So BYCombo is happy to see our bands partner with powerful insiders.

### Responsible revolutions plan for runaway effects

Indie rock is a culture of self-reliance that celebrates artists who bypass the middleman. But if the middleman's job is simple enough for anyone to do, then wealthy artists can just pay *others* to do it. As a result, indie rock has become a trust fund playground, leading to today's disillusionment. Yet this was foreseeable from day one!

Won't BYCombo see a runaway effect as well? Yes, but ours is foreseeably a race to the *top*. Taking our approach to its absurd conclusion, a band might spend an *insane* chunk of lifetime on their demo— which pretty much *guarantees* they'll be remembered by history!

### *For* hungry outsiders, *by* a hungry outsider

Who foresaw indie rock's absurd conclusion? Minorities did— which is why they've never founded a culture that rewards self-reliance. Instead, their movements value what can't be bought: talent and originality born from hunger. And BYCombo is the latest case in point.

Don't be fooled by indie rock's recent embrace of female and minority artists: They've been handed the reins *because* it's in decline. These are crumbs on offer here. Meanwhile, BYCombo was *conceived* to serve anyone who's disadvantaged. We know that disadvantage drives your desire for *mutual* reliance, as well as your hunger to aim for the *top* of the pantheon.

### Art needs the blood of martyrs

Indie rock is all about fair compensation: Artists must never give more of themselves than they take. Not even voluntarily, since this is a slippery slope that leads to further expectations of sacrifice all around. As such, indie rock has never given the world a rock martyr— and proudly so.

Yet rock *needs* martyrs, because the farthest heights and ends of the art form can only be reached at great personal cost. Let's never go back to the days of artists dying young, of course. But thankfully, history tells of another kind of martyr: those willing to sacrifice not their *lives*, but their *lifetimes*.

And how about you? Are you willing to sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime to advance the art form? If so, then apply to BYCombo!
