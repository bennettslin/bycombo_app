# The problem with indie rock

Bennett here! I've spent half my life arguing that indie rock has made music worse, to no avail. But in recent years, something amazing has happened: People have started to agree with me. Which means the interdependence revolution can begin!

There's just one problem: Indie rock isn't so much a genre as it is a system of rule. So how do we revolt against it, when systems prevent revolution by design? Luckily, I've spent half my life figuring this out as well: Through BYCombo, we'll assemble interdependent bands committed to making historically consequential demos.

### The next revolution starts from centralized initiatives

Why historical consequence? Because when people say that rock music has gotten worse, this is what they really have in mind. Yes, talent still exists, but history no longer cares by default. What's needed from today's artists is an explicit intent to make art that lasts, and only a centralized initiative like BYCombo can light this fire.

Why assembled bands? Because there are revolutionary acts still to come; they're just no longer likely to come together on their own. How do five musicians committed to making history find each other across the globe? How does a comic book artist join as a full-fledged member? Centralized initiatives are also needed to form unprecedented ensembles.

Why interdependence? Why demos? Because to make consequential art, a band needs to build exceptional strengths. But this isn't humanly possible unless they stay weak in areas that a label will later cover. Which is to say, consequential art *needs* to be interdependent; it *needs* to partner with a label. And demos are what a band sounds like before they've found theirs.

### Serendipity favors a single hat

Indie rock requires artists to wear several hats: the influencer hat, the publicist hat… of course, the best among them don't skimp on wearing the artist hat. They want their art to stay on par with their level of talent.

But the best works of art are *better* than the artists who make them. Why? Because they also benefit from so many eureka moments that can't be repeated at will. And these moments emerge from unconscious thinking that easily gets disrupted by switching hats. As such, BYCombo lets you keep the artist hat on. You want your art to be better than you, and so do we.

### Middling power leads to risk aversion

In his book *Originals*, Adam Grant points out that in any hierarchy, the ones eager to take risks are those at the bottom with nothing to lose, and those safely perched at the top. By contrast, those in the middle are the most risk averse. This might explain why indie rock is so unoriginal. Its artists seek power while its labels relinquish it, which results in *no one* taking risks.

Because indie artists strive for power from the get-go, they're immediately beholden to the current paradigm that empowers them. And then they never learn to question *any* paradigm. This is why BYCombo encourages bands to treat their powerless years as a creative asset: While you have nothing to lose, what paradigms are you free to challenge?

### The masses are last to join the revolution

Meanwhile, because indie labels *lack* power, they only make safe bets. And the safest bet is to give the masses what they already want. This creates an echo chamber, the same kind that makes streaming algorithms so detrimental to art. Even worse, it means the current paradigm can never change, because the masses *never* ask for paradigm change on their own.

Revolutions that challenge the current paradigm may *start* with powerless outsiders, but they're *popularized* by powerful insiders. Far from exploiting such movements, those at the top play a crucial role in getting buy-in from the masses. This may not jibe with anyone's anti-establishment fantasy, but it's the historical truth. So BYCombo works with it.

### Responsible revolutions plan for runaway effects

Indie rock is a culture of self-reliance that gives artists the tools needed to bypass the middleman. But if the middleman's job is simple enough for artists to do themselves, then any wealthy artist can easily pay *others* to do it. As a result, indie rock has devolved into a trust fund playground, leading to today's disillusionment. Yet this was foreseeable from day one!

Will BYCombo also devolve? Well, a band taking our approach to its absurd conclusion would spend an *entire* lifetime on their demo. But if anything, doing this practically *guarantees* that you'll be remembered by history!

### *For* hungry outsiders, *by* a hungry outsider

Who foresaw indie rock's absurd conclusion? Minorities did— which is why they've never founded a culture that rewards self-reliance. Instead, their movements value what can't be bought: talent and originality born from hunger. And BYCombo is the latest case in point.

Don't be fooled by indie rock's recent embrace of female and minority artists: They've been handed the reins *because* it's in decline. These are crumbs on offer here. Meanwhile, BYCombo was *conceived* to serve women, minorities, and all others who face disadvantages. We know that disadvantage drives your instinct for *mutual* reliance, as well as your hunger to aim for the *top* of the pantheon.

### Art needs the blood of martyrs

Indie rock is all about fair compensation: Artists must never give more of themselves than they take. Not even voluntarily, since this is a slippery slope that leads to further expectations of sacrifice all around. As such, indie rock has never given the world a rock and roll martyr— and proudly so.

Yet rock *needs* martyrs, because the farthest heights and ends of the art form can only be reached at great personal cost. Let's never return to the days of artists dying young, of course. But thankfully, history tells of another kind of martyr: those willing to give up not their *lives*, but their *lifetimes*.

So are you willing to sacrifice a solid chunk of lifetime for the betterment of rock music? BYCombo is here for you!
