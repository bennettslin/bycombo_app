By the '90s, the major labels were the clear "bad guys": Hoping for a Nirvana or Radiohead to break out, they'd sign a hundred no-names to unfair terms. The indie labels held to fair practices, however, by only signing artists who *already* had a fanbase and thus *didn't* need a label. A decade later, the majors got disrupted by the Internet— so the "good guys" won! Except now…

Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://bobtailyearlings.com) here! As an Xennial, I've spent half my life arguing that indie rock's fair practices have made music *worse*— to no avail. The way Millennials saw it: "Thanks to all these new tech platforms, you can hustle to build a fanbase on your own; and the better your works, the farther you'll go! So if you hate it… well, what does that say about your works?"

Thus I was left to struggle in a world that *wouldn't* speak out against indie rock. But now Gen Z is coming of age and dealing with the [same struggles](http://archive.today/2024.02.01/https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/2/1/24056883/tiktok-self-promotion-artist-career-how-to-build-following)— which suggests they're ready to listen. On top of that, they'd *love* a Nirvana and Radiohead of their own. So let the interdependence revolution begin!

### The revolution will *not* be decentralized

First, we raise *awareness*. Since "indie" means "good" to so many, few notice the adverse effects of what I call "indiefication"— namely, the propagation of indie rock's founding ideals across *all* the music genres, and even all the *arts*. You know the ideals I'm talking about: cutting out the middleman, lowering the barriers to entry, respecting direct fan engagement…

And… of course: replacing elitist gatekeepers with indie tastemakers! What's the difference? A gatekeeper helps to take you "from [zero to one](https://bennettsamuellin.blogspot.com/2012/08/pseudepigrapha.html#:~:text=All%20the%20time,your%20actual%20being.)"— that is, to make you known as an artist… but only if *you*, on your own, have what it takes to go "from one to *n*"— to get the public to care; whereas a tastemaker does it the other way around. "Okay. And knowing this leads to revolution… How?"

Well, since gatekeepers look for low-status no-names with one-to-*n* talents, their aim is to up-*end* the status hierarchy— placing them on the artistic *left*. But tastemakers prefer the artist who's *already* gone from zero to one… and thus *already* enjoys higher status. This means they up-*hold* the hierarchy— which puts them on the *right*! So here's what needs to be explained:

**By telling *all* artists to be indie— in other words, to get themselves known— Millennials swung hard to the artistic right. If the arts are to be saved, then, a counterculture of the left must now rise up to *oppose* indie rock's ideals.**

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review.
`}

From there, we take *action*. Rebelling against centralized institutions would be easy, right? Just… tear them down! But against indie rock's *de*-centralized structures, we must *build*— and this is far more difficult. After all, build *what*, exactly? Fortunately, I've also spent half my life coming up with a plan:

**BYCombo's assembled bands will aim for the historical canon by sacrificing serious chunks of lifetime to make demos, which they'll then show in our demo registry to seek amnesty from interdependence-minded partners.**

### Why BYCombo?

Okay, that's a mouthful! Let's break it down…

**Why amnesty?**

Being "good guys," the indie tastemakers promise *not* to gatekeep; instead, they obey the people's will by only picking artists with an existing fanbase. For this reason, Millennials cheered when indie rock took over— while the people now support *every* indie artist who gets picked. Yet despite all these good intentions in our times… the arts [have *declined*](https://billderesiewicz.com/books/the-death-of-the-artist)?!

The best such intention, as we all know, is for artists to be self-empowered enough *not* to need a label. But this forces them to divert efforts away from the craft, toward the hustle— making it a de facto *rule*, since any who *don't* will remain unknown. Yet breaking this rule is the best way to *reverse* our decline! So why not lighten the punishment for those who try?

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review.
`}

Sadly, once the good guys are in charge, the generation who put them there will turn conservative— and thereafter help to *enforce* the rules. But suppose that society never *again* "forgives" its rule breakers? What we need, then, is for a progressive institution like BYCombo to *codify* the practice of doing so— an amnesty program for the arts, if I may.

**Why the historical canon?**

When fans support an artist, they want art that engages with them directly— which is to say, *content*. But while content wins out in the present over *past* art, it loses once its *own* time has passed. To belong in the [historical canon](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446), then, today's artists must *aim* for it— because without this conscious intent, they'll naturally settle for being content creators instead.

**Why bands?**

Indie rock encourages artists to retain their earnings— which, today, means having fewer bandmates, if any. But what competitive edge could a solo artist possibly have nowadays, to put them among the best for all *time*? From now until forever, if artists want to make history, they'll need to be greater than the sum of their parts— and in rock, this happens by forming *bands*.

**Why band *assembly*?**

Has rock explored all the ways a band can come together? It sure seems so— assuming they'll always do so on their own, in a decentralized free-for-all. But let's ditch this notion. What if musicians hoping to form history-making bands could flock to a single hub from across the world? What if a cartoonist could also join— and bands, in turn, could think to look for one?

Or— suppose the next Kurt Cobain is a minority woman who's struggling to attract bandmates. What if she could ask to be judged free of unconscious bias? With so many ways to innovate in this space, there most certainly *are* canonical bands still to come! All that's needed is a centralized nonprofit like BYCombo to help them come together.

**Why partners?**

To make history, a band must be exceptionally strong in the ways of art. But this isn't humanly possible unless they *also* stay weak in matters of business, like marketing and distribution. To put it another way, history makers *need* to work with a label— or some other business partner!— and a quick glance through the historical canon bears this out.

**Why interdependence?**

Partners are most impactful when helping to make you known as an artist— to take you "from zero to one," as they say. But an indie tastemaker holds off *until* you're known, then helps to make the public care— to take you "from one to *n*." Yet, at that point, their business skills have far less impact…

Meanwhile, your artistic talents work the *opposite* way: They get you far once you're *already* known; where they stumble, though, is in getting you known to *begin* with. Yet it's the latter effort— a sign of your *indie*-pendence— that a tastemaker needs to see! Which raises a good question: If your partner can't grasp the concept of *inter*-dependence… are they even a partner at all?

**Why demos?**

A demo shows what a work can be in the *future*, with a partner's help. This doesn't just free a band to take creative risks; it awakens the very thought to try— with "[doublespeaker rhyme](https://yearlingsbobtail.com/4-odin/?verse=1&annotation=7)" being my own go-to example. Yes, anyone today can self-release their works… but this isn't a *blessing*; it's a *curse*! Past artists got started with *demos*— and to rival them means doing likewise.

**Why a demo *registry*?**

Stellar demos signify exceptional talent— yet finding one requires sifting through *hundreds*. So the indie tastemakers rarely bother, since *any* artist they pick will be charitably supported just the same. In turn, this means an interdependent band's best bet is to partner with *elites*— who alone have a "noblesse oblige" to help those being *hurt* by the people's good intentions.

But the elites have their own reason to hesitate: Anytime they release a work that sounds like a demo they once rejected, this opens them up to a lawsuit. So what we need now is a demo registry— namely, an online location where anyone can *discreetly* check out the latest bands trying to make history.

**Why serious chunks of lifetime?**

Low barriers to entry have allowed an endless stream of middling artists to pour through, leading the public to grow weary and lose interest. But indie rock can't reverse this damage, given its decentralized nature. To regain the public's trust, then, a centralized nonprofit like BYCombo must now serve as a gatekeeper for the elites— by helping them enforce a steep *cost* of entry.

This cost can't be arbitrary or artificial, so it can only be one thing: a serious chunk of lifetime. After all, a lifetime is all you have; once that chunk is gone, it's *gone*! Which means there's nothing more precious for a band to sacrifice, in making their case for amnesty.

**And finally, how has indie rock made music worse?**

Here are fifty ways…

### ${++sectionCounter}. Nursed grievances wallow in confusion

In the '90s, "indie" referred to bands like Pavement, who'd only *ever* signed to an indie label. Since Nirvana and Radiohead were on *major* labels, this made them [alternative, not indie](https://substack.com/@bobtail/note/c-106073033)— as Gen X knows. To Millennials, though, a band is indie if they *sound* indie… so now we're all waiting for the *indies* to give us the next Nirvana or Radiohead. Oof! How did we get confused?

Simply put, indie rock doesn't know what it stands *for*, only whom it stands *against*: the majors and their middlemen. Like MAGA, it's a culture driven by anti-establishment grievances— and as such, it shares the same weakness for confusion. After all: "Who cares if those on our side are confused in their beliefs? This is what fires them up to tear down the system!"

For instance, even after Goatse proved that the Internet caters to the lowest common denominator… the indie camp concluded that going viral is the new [word-of-mouth](http://archive.today/2025.03.05/https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1811-clap-your-hands-say-yeah/#:~:text=Indie%20rock%20has%20received,supposed%20to%20work!) buzz?! And when Amanda Palmer crowdfunded her way to a million dollars upon leaving a major… this was seen as proof that artists *don't* benefit from a label deal?! Yes, I'm talking about the former [human statue](https://www.ted.com/talks/amanda_palmer_the_art_of_asking)!

Let's face it, in every early example of online success… chance, privilege, or sheer opportunism played a clear role. Yet the indie camp was so eager to spurn the majors, they downplayed this point. Well, it worked: The Internet came to be seen as a meritocracy, where *anyone* can make it. Except now, if an artist struggles to do so… the public *has* to assume they're unworthy!

As with MAGA, then, indie rock's weakness for confusion ends up hurting its own. So yes, the majors in their heyday did many things wrong— but they got Nirvana and Radiohead *right*! How? With BYCombo, you can join those of us willing to ask… because we nurse no grievances.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Populism trampled the underground

We all respect those alternative bands of the ['80s underground](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/michael-azerrad/our-band-could-be-your-life/9780316787536), right? "Yes! They were chosen by the people, *not* by the elites." Well, actually… this is yet more Millennial confusion. Back then, the underground was a shelter both for rock's underclass— who *subverted* the people's will— and for the elitist snobs who championed their works; it *wasn't* for everyone.

In the '90s, though, as bands began to leave for the major labels, "alternative" came to imply selling out; those who stayed [thus became](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=alternative+rock%2Cindie+rock&year_start=1980&year_end=2000) "indie" instead. Yet if being indie just means *not* signing to a major, then it *can* be for everyone— so once the Internet made this possible, the indie camp argued that it *should* be. Now *anyone* who hustles to build a fanbase is considered indie!

But this includes artists with mainstream tastes… who easily gain the most fans. Which means *they're* the ones getting picked by the indie tastemakers! Sometime in the '00s, then, indie rock renounced its elitism and became a [populist movement](http://archive.today/2025.03.05/https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/6672-okkervil-river/#:~:text=I%20guess%20I,had%20%5Blaughs%5D.) instead, as it went from championing the under-*class*— who *aren't* for everyone… to rooting for under-*dogs*— who *can* be.

Yet in *obeying* the people's will at all times, populism is just democracy with no [judicial safeguard](http://archive.today/2025.03.17/https://www.fjc.gov/history/administration/executive-enforcement-judicial-orders#:~:text=While%20the%20story,Trail%20of%20Tears.)— making it *tyranny* [for the underclass](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/andrew-jackson-americas-original-anti-establishment-candidate-180958621/#:~:text=Jackson%E2%80%99s%20populism%20was,plentiful%20free%20land.). We learned this in high school! So what happens now, if *your* works are too subversive to ever be for everyone? Why, you can rest assured: BYCombo is here to restore the judiciary— in the arts, at least!— by calling for a new generation of elites.

### ${++sectionCounter}. The grassroots is now a lottery

Of course, there's another reason we respect those '80s underground bands: To come up from their local scenes— also known as the grassroots— they put in the work each day for untold years. In other words, they ensured their own legacies— unlike a one-hit wonder, who simply signed to a major label for a single chance at public exposure… and then won the "lottery," so to speak.

Thanks to online tools, though, today's lottery players get *unlimited* chances. Moreover, rather than go through the majors to spread their works from the top down, they now win the people's support from the bottom up— making the Internet our new grassroots. Which explains why we don't hear about one-hit wonders anymore: They've become indie artists in good faith!

By recasting itself as a populist movement, then, indie rock didn't just adopt the mainstream's *tastes*, but also its *indeterminacy*— where little but chance separates the few who make it from the millions who don't. But what if *you're* determined to ensure your own legacy? Then keep working on your craft for untold years— and let BYCombo expose you to the next elites!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Charity escalates into an arms race

In the past, we didn't "support" artists— [outside of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_music) the *true* charity cases, like amateurs, recluses, the mentally ill… Yet today's fans will charitably support *any* artist, even a superstar— in a trend known as "poptimism." How did this happen? It began when indie rock conflated personal taste with endowment for the arts, making every fan a philanthropist— a "phlan," maybe?

Unlike an arts foundation, though, phlans *don't* need to hold strict standards or be aware of unconscious bias. Their charitable support for the underdog— *any* underdog— comes from good intentions and thus can't be questioned. But then… this *isn't* just a leg up, is it? It's a winning advantage! And unlike amateurs or the mentally ill, indie artists *do* vie for all the [same honors](https://pitchfork.com/news/45374-bon-iver-wins-grammys-for-best-new-artist-best-alternative-music-album).

So indie rock set off a chain reaction, forcing the next tier of artists above to beg for support as well, and then the next… leading to our present time of poptimism, when even superstars angle to be seen as underdogs. Which is why Millennials never gave us a Shaggs or Daniel Johnston of their own: All their charitable impulses went toward defending the surefire *winners*!

And yet… this obviously can't end well. We don't support artists of the *past*— and neither will future audiences. So why stoop to being a charity case today, just to be swept onto an ash heap tomorrow? With BYCombo, you can keep your dignity instead— knowing it's the *only* way to make history.

### ${++sectionCounter}. History making is now a mere hobby

By supporting artists, then, we're both needlessly kind to the ones at the top, and cruel to those at the very bottom. "Is that so bad?" Yes, because there's a third and final effect: The history makers of our times… now get relegated to the *bottom*! To see why this is so, let's imagine a government program that promises a living wage and free health care to *every* artist.

Well… we're *all* free to make art, right? Which means the government must first separate "real" artists, who need its support, from mere hobbyists, who don't. Whatever criteria it chooses, though, will be based on the way artists have *always* worked. So anyone trying to create a *new* paradigm— to rethink how art can be made, or by whom— will be dismissed as a hobbyist!

Furthermore, it's up to each of us to decide that we've studied and practiced long enough, and now our years as a working artist may begin. But if a living wage is what's at stake, then who wouldn't want those years to begin *sooner*? Meanwhile, anyone making dense and complex works that require decades of quiet preparation… will be paying their own way the *whole* time.

To be clear, I'm not against, let's say, *universal* health care. When we support artists in *particular*, however, the ones most likely to make history… stand to gain the *least*! Luckily, I realized this early on— having only *ever* been seen as a hobbyist by the indie tastemakers. Now BYCombo helps you find partners who'd rather give amnesty to the best… than charity to all the rest.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Cultural chauvinism can only be justified

Growing up as a child of Asian immigrants, I knew that the rock canon of our English-speaking world wasn't the only one; [other countries](https://youtu.be/QhOFg_3RV5Q) had their own. Yet because they derived from ours, we cared little for theirs— which made ours "the" canon! Especially since any of their bands who *could* rival us, like ABBA… would simply join us instead.

So I've long understood that, to belong in the canon next to the Beatles, my band needs to be one of the best in the *world*. But the indie camp scorns my way of thinking, saying it reeks of cultural chauvinism: "Who are we to think we're better than other countries? Let a thousand canons bloom, with ours being just one of them!"

Yet the same camp then gripes about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, saying it doesn't give [recent artists](https://uproxx.com/indie/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-bias-against-alt-indie-rock) a fair chance to get in. But unlike past inductees, this century's indie artists *aren't* better than their foreign contemporaries— who have *no* chance! So they're *not* helping to justify calling ours "the" rock canon… in which case, why would they belong in "the" Rock Hall?

Let's be honest, we're cultural chauvinists either way; all we can do is not be hypocrites as well. Fortunately, BYCombo is here to make us the world's best once more, in the only way now possible: by matching you with artists from other countries, who *could* rival you… but will join your band instead.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Talent seeks a path to stardom

By the '00s, the major labels had gutted the local scenes in their search for the next superstars. So when the Internet promised us a vibrant "long tail" decoupled from the rat race for stardom, indie rock went all in: Any artist could now flourish on the fringes! Yet today… superstars are bigger than ever, while indie artists have *lost* cultural relevance. Why is this?

For starters, the winner-take-all aspect of stardom *isn't* caused by corporate greed, but by our human nature. Since it's hard to say whose works are best, we often just like what others like— and they do the same! As a result, any [random boost](http://archive.today/2024.07.19/https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/magazine/15wwlnidealab.t.html#:~:text=The%20reason%20is,in%20her%20place.) can snowball into a winning advantage— and *this* is how the less worthy end up as superstars.

Yet stardom is also the rightful outcome for the *most* worthy artists, who naturally hope for it— even if, like Kurt Cobain, they won't admit it. So the indie camp got it backward here as well: The majors *didn't* exploit the local scenes. They simply saw the indie labels as "farm teams"— as did those '90s alternative bands, who signed with the indies for this very reason!

By blocking access to the majors, then, indie rock *didn't* help the most worthy artists flourish; it caused them to flee! Thankfully, BYCombo is here to build a *new* path to stardom. Because, once you go above and beyond to make the best art, you *won't* just settle for a "[thousand true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans)." And if superstars are inevitable… then why can't *you* get a chance to be one?

### ${++sectionCounter}. Posterity is awarded by peer review

The reverse is also true, of course: Those who'd settle for a "thousand true fans" *won't* try to make the best art. Yet indie rock wants a "long tail" of such artists! So how are *any* of them expected to make history? The critics have a plan: Pick a few to represent the underdogs of our times, then rally around them. After all: "Who wouldn't root for an underdog to win?"

Um… all of us other artists who *weren't* picked, that's who! To be clear, we're not "crabs in a bucket." But if a critical darling strikes us as a "lottery" winner, we won't pretend otherwise. And this gets at why [critics are so bad](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/why-did-the-beatles-get-so-many-bad) at making timeless judgments: They never consider how things look to us *other* artists.

Because we're invested in the creative process ourselves, we commit fewer false *positives*: We know when a work that gets rave reviews is, in fact, par for the course. And we commit fewer false *negatives*: We'll give radical new ideas a chance, knowing the courage it takes to put them into action. In short, what historians will see in *time*… other artists [come closest](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/managers-are-not-best-judge-creative-ideas#:~:text=Berg%20attributes%20creators,ideas%20may%20succeed.%E2%80%9D) to seeing *today*.

For instance, during the Galant, a time that favored simplicity, Bach's music was derided as old-fashioned and soon forgotten by the public. Even so, his renown as a "composer's composer" grew: To learn counterpoint, [you'd study](https://bobtailyearlings.com/docs/Bach_analysis.jpg) his works. Now three centuries onward, Bach is regarded as the greatest of all time… while I've yet to meet *anyone* whose favorite style is Galant.

In essence, ignore the critics, or any others who think history making is all a crapshoot! There *is* a reliable measure of your chances: It's how much your talents, originality, and courage inspire the envy of fellow *artists*, relative to your fame. So join us at BYCombo, and surround yourself with peers who'll keep your standards high… as we wait out this century's own Galant era.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Time is kind to craft, not context

To get radio airplay in the '90s, alternative bands had to win over listeners who knew nothing about them— and the best did this by crafting melodies and chords that hook you in with no further context. Being an unpopular teen at the time, I knew my only hope was to pull off the same. So I studied any band whose talents I envied, dreaming that one day I'd teach others.

A while back, I sent copies of my songwriting book [*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com) to all the indie labels; I later did the same with my musical tile game [*Bobtail Dominoes*](https://bobtaildominoes.com). "The best melodies and chords come through study and practice," I pointed out— but they weren't interested. In time I figured out why: It's not that they doubted my point; they just don't value music as a *craft* to begin with!

After losing too many radio-friendly bands to the major labels, the indies learned to bypass radio altogether by appealing to critics and local fans. But critics want context that can be discussed at length, while local fans— now online— want direct engagement from the artist; so both, in their own way, are drawn more to a well-constructed *persona* than to a well-crafted *hook*.

Any demand for such hooks, then, came *solely* from radio… which means the death of radio *also* killed off those who excelled at crafting them: bands like the [Smashing Pumpkins](https://youtu.be/GVDWSTCKgng) or [Stone Temple Pilots](https://youtu.be/PAHLpaYQDds), in my day. And since critics tended to *hate* these bands, the indie camp simply jeered: "Well, well, well… it looks like [backstory and lore](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/when-pavement-penned-a-track-to-insult-the-smashing-pumpkins) win out over melodies and chords!"

Yet the past artists we love most *don't* require us to dive into any surrounding "lore," do they? History, then… is like radio! So don't get complacent in this online era: To be timeless, your music still needs to hook listeners on its *own*. Which is why BYCombo lets you take the time to master your craft— as if you were an Xennial child hoping to get on the radio one day.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Mastery carries a steep opportunity cost

Guess who thought music was already worse by the '90s? [Kurt Cobain](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-amplified-come-as-you-are-michael-azerrad)! He didn't think Gen X could rival the Silents and Boomers who started the rock renaissance. Of course, this "[anxiety of influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_of_influence)" is precisely what got them to try much harder, to be much better, thus averting any predicted disaster— like the world's handwringing in preparation for Y2K.

But in hindsight, it all *seemed* to be much ado about nothing— so Millennials drew the wrong lesson: "Whatever happens is what history will remember!" As a result, they [were thrilled](https://bennettsamuellin.blogspot.com/2013/05/undoing-stupid-damage.html#:~:text=What%20if%20the,movement%20anytime%20soon?) to see *anything* happen… and never wondered what could've happened *instead*, had they held out for better works. Still, why didn't more artists try to *show* them how much better a work can be?

Well, let's examine today's options. An artist can hustle to build a fanbase— which yields *compound* returns, as each fan brings in new fans; plus, with no talent scouts to discover them, it's a huge disadvantage *not* to. Or, they can go above and beyond to make the best works— which yields *diminishing* returns for every *increase* in effort; yet, by definition, it *isn't* a disadvantage not to!

It's clear, then, why music was better before "indiefication": The *only* option was to try and be the best. Today? Pick this option, and you'll have *no* fans— making you the biggest loser, in the indie camp's view. And yet… indie rock didn't exactly *win*, did it? So history *isn't* just "whatever happened"! Luckily, with BYCombo, Gen Z can now hold out for your works.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Serendipity rewards the idle mind

Are you unconvinced that music is now worse? Then ask this about any of the latest artists: Whatever their best work might be, could they *guarantee* us another one just as good? I suspect we'll agree: The answer is yes. That is to say, even the best works today simply *match* the talents of those who make them; they're what I call "workhorse art."

By contrast, could Dolly Parton *reliably* compose one "[Jolene](https://youtu.be/Ixrje2rXLMA)" after another? Or [Stephen Sondheim](https://bobtailyearlings.com/docs/Sondheim_paper.pdf), "[Someone in a Tree](https://youtu.be/JpoKuNyVNhQ)"? It's doubtful. These are what I call "windfall art"— namely, works that are even *better* than those who make them. In fact, some of them seem to surpass what's humanly possible at *all*— and for this reason, they're the kind that fellow artists envy most.

Of course, the best artists *are* human— so how are such works possible? It's because they *don't* benefit from talents alone, but *also* from creative insights that emerge from the unconscious mind and can't be summoned at will. In other words, spend enough time letting your [thoughts drift](https://paulgraham.com/top.html#:~:text=I%20suspect%20a,to%20change%20something.) in the shower, or daydreaming out of boredom… and the next "Jolene" just might be *yours*!

But… this won't happen if you're always multitasking. No wonder, then, that "indiefication" has made music worse! Indie artists *endlessly* switch between multiple hats: the promoter hat, the publicist hat… So keep your artist hat on, and have partners wear the others. Because *you* want your works to be better than you— and so does BYCombo.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Modest standing leads to risk aversion

In his book [*Originals*](https://adamgrant.net/book/originals), Adam Grant points out that in any hierarchy, the ones eager to take risks are those securely perched at the top, as well as those at the bottom with nothing to lose. The ones in the middle, by contrast, are the most risk-*averse*. Which explains why indie rock is so *un*-original: Its artists *seek* greater standing while its labels *cede* it— so *no one* takes any risks!

In the past, bands relied on *others* to make them known— to take them "from zero to one." In turn, it was on *them* to get the public to care— to go "from one to *n*"— and so they'd explore at will, hoping to find the unexpected. But today, indie artists get *themselves* known— leaving them reluctant to experiment, for fear of losing hard-won fans.

Meanwhile, the major labels in their heyday had hefty budgets to work with, which allowed them to [diversify their rosters](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/importance-diversification) by casting a wide net for talent. And since greater risks yield [greater rewards](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskreturntradeoff.asp), they'd keep a few slots open for unknown artists with unexpected ideas— some of whom ended up making the boldest art!

By contrast, the indie labels sign just one artist at a time, so they go with the safe bet, *every* time, of simply picking what the people want. But people only want what they [know to expect](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/988332-some-people-say-give-the-customers-what-they-want-but)… thus creating an echo chamber! This is why BYCombo lets you explore and experiment, while you have no fans to lose: It makes you the *smart* bet, for those seated high— or low!— enough to see it.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Creativity gets its chance from the clueless

In the past, the indie tastemakers stayed close to their local scenes, making them both "in the know" and "one of us." And now online, they offer the same assurance: What they like is what others like *us* have liked— which means it's what *we'll* like. What's not to like? Well, in *my* case… this is what led them to reject *Yearling's Bobtail*— my "*Ulysses* of rock albums"!

What confused me is that I'd [explicitly set out](https://yearlingsbobtail.com/8-good-night-sita/?verse=61&annotation=40) to make a [work of art](https://yearlingsbobtail.com/10-constellations/?verse=1&annotation=9) whose creativity *can't* be disputed. Only later did it hit me: If a tastemaker is one of *us*, then this is the *last* thing they'd want— since it's the last thing *we* want. Our human nature is to [*dis*-like creativity](http://archive.today/2024.08.26/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/16/science/creativity-implicit-bias.html); we just don't realize this, because whatever it is we *do* like… we simply call *that* the creative idea of our times!

In truth, creativity is unfamiliar, and this makes us uncomfortable. Now, the corporate "suits" just ignore the discomfort, since it's *all* unfamiliar to them. Those in the know, however, pride themselves on their intuition— and thus interpret any discomfort as a sincere warning from the gut. Ironically, then, as [Frank Zappa](https://youtu.be/xP4wsURn3rw) noted, this makes them *worse* at picking creative ideas!

Consequently, it's often those with the [*least* experience](https://youtu.be/AClN5X0eEvI) in a given genre who end up backing its canonical works: By *not* knowing what the people want, they *can't* be led astray! Let's face it, the best partners take pride in doing good *business*— not in knowing great *art*. Now with BYCombo, you can find one to back you once again.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Lean operations fail to adapt

Can the indie labels learn *not* to be led astray? No, they're overworked and underpaid— or, in their words, "lean and scrappy"— and this is their selling point; by *not* hiring middlemen, they pass the savings onto the artist. Then, to free up "bandwidth," they just follow the instincts handed down by their forebears— like moths, which evolved to [orient themselves](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/jan/30/why-are-moths-attracted-to-lights-science-answer#:~:text=moths%20and%20many,they%20flew%20level.) by starlight.

Of course, these instincts made sense in the '80s, when underground bands would build a fanbase by playing local shows. It's precisely *because* word of mouth only traveled locally, for example, that the indies came to trust it so highly. And likewise with their respect for direct fan engagement: Back then, it was only *ever* possible with a local gathering.

But today, algorithms have turned word of mouth into wisdom of the crowd— which settles on an average by canceling out all extremes. And social media has made engaging with fans trivial; those who do so now might enjoy *fame*, but never *acclaim*. Yet the indies haven't noticed! Like moths circling a flame, they're stuck with outdated instincts in a modern world…

Worse still, they assume that *all* of us can— and thus *should*— aim to be lean and scrappy as well! Naturally, then, when the tech platforms came along to optimize the arts, the indie camp cheered— much like the political right did when DOGE promised to optimize the government. Now even today's *major* labels are too overworked and underpaid to get with the times…

So yes, middlemen might *seem* redundant— but redundancy keeps a system resilient, allowing it [to adapt](https://www.forkingpaths.co/p/against-optimization#:~:text=Optimizing%20for%20efficiency,bet%20for%20humanity.)! This is why BYCombo tells you to be generous in splitting your earnings with bandmates and business partners: How else will *any* of us have the bandwidth to bring music into the present century?

### ${++sectionCounter}. Disintermediation is a middleman's wish

To help artists cut out the middleman, indie rock provides them with tools to do the middleman's job for themselves. Of course, the "Bizarro" way would be to empower *middlemen* to do the *artist's* job. Absurd, right? Yet the outcome would be exactly the same, with each person now doing the job of both artist *and* middleman. So indie rock… is its own Bizarro world!

And here's more absurdity: Whereas artists are loved for doing what we'd all rather do, middlemen are hated for taking on work that few others enjoy. In this new hybrid role, then, an artist *has* to be their own middleman… but a middleman *gets* to be their own artist. So "indiefication" is really the wish of a *middling* artist— who'd otherwise only qualify to *be* a middleman!

Let's be clear, the best artists *value* the middleman. After all, when you're the best at your job, it's a waste of your talents to do anyone else's— and knowing that your own job is way harder than it looks, you have to assume the same of everyone else's. Plus, as one of the best yourself, you get your pick of the best partners. It's called division of labor; we learned this in middle school!

Sad to say, young folks don't question today's auto-Bizarro world, since it's all they've ever known. But I came of age *before* indie rock took over, so I've only *ever* dreamt of having one job as an artist— seeing as there's no other way to make the best art! Now with BYCombo, this dream can be yours as well.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Self-reliance is a partisan ideal

Want even *more* absurdity? Any rich artist can simply pay *others* to do the middleman's job for them… and, well, who better to hire than a freelance middleman?! So in the end, indie rock has done little more than "privatize" access to business deals that were once a "public good"— to the benefit of the privileged. How did this happen?

It's simple: Indie rock is widely seen as a [do-it-yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself) movement— the kind that fosters *cooperative* self-reliance by instilling a love for the craft. As such, it meets with no opposition and enjoys all the same goodwill. Now, this *would* be fitting… if indie artists only made music for their *own* fulfillment.

But being indie is all about gaining public exposure— and this is a zero-sum game: When attention is paid to one artist, it *isn't* being paid to the rest. So the indie camp is really about *competitive* self-reliance! Like libertarians in politics, they want "doing it yourself" to be how you even survive at *all*… and having privilege is the [greatest predictor](http://archive.today/2025.09.26/https://www.cracked.com/article_40871_penn-jillette-wants-to-talk-it-all-out.html#:~:text=Many%20times%20when,100%20percent%20accurate.) of this belief.

The problem, then, is that indie rock's artistic libertarianism is a *partisan* ideal that gets mistaken as *universal*; thus an "opposition party" has never arisen. So how do we start one? Here's a clue: In Ayn Rand's *Atlas Shrugged*— a novel popular with libertarians— the industrial world's "indie camp" goes on strike against nationalization by *refusing* to help society advance.

To protest against "indiefication," then, interdependent bands should do the opposite, and *readily* advance the art form… even when this hurts their *own* prospects! So ignore those who'd advise you to be self-reliant, saying there's no other path. There is one *now*, with BYCombo— the amnesty program for artistic progressives, who self-sacrifice out of love for the craft.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Mutual reliance creates wealth

In game theory, the "stag hunt" is a game in which you and another player must decide, each on your own, whether to hunt hares separately, or team up and hunt a stag together. The stag yields far more meat, even when split two ways. But if you trust the other player and go for the stag— only for *them* to doubt *you* and thus stick with hares— you'll end up with nothing.

The richest nations build systems that allow their citizens to trust each other and confidently "hunt the stag," creating more wealth for all. The opposite is also true: North Korea, a poor nation, leaves its citizens to "hunt hares"— and fittingly, its [state ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche) translates to "self-reliance." Well, now you know where this is going: Indie rock… is the North Korea of music!

Indie artists strive *not* to need a label, and some [keep at it](http://archive.today/2024.05.11/https://pitchfork.com/news/34979-amanda-palmer-tells-roadrunner-records-please-drop-me/#:~:text=I%27ve%20built%20up,totally%20DIY%20operation.) even after signing to one— on the label's dime! So labels have learned to doubt artists as well… destroying the mutual reliance needed to create cultural wealth. Yet there's hope: Much like South Korea shows how North Korea might one day thrive, the past proves that rock can be interdependent once again!

BYCombo just needs artists like you, who *want* to need a label, to join with the Bobtail Yearlings and go for the stag, over and over— despite ending up with nothing, again and again— until others finally [reciprocate the courage](http://archive.today/2024.05.11/https://slate.com/culture/2007/09/the-obscure-game-theory-problem-that-explains-why-rich-countries-are-rich.html#:~:text=One%20worrying%20outcome,regain%20once%20lost.) to partner with us. Yes, it's the definition of insanity… but to stick with hares is to live in cultural poverty forever. So how about it?

### ${++sectionCounter}. Democratization causes noise pollution

To "democratize" Twitter, Elon Musk made the blue checkmark available to all, for a [small fee](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1587498907336118274); he wanted *everyone* to have a voice, not just those verified under legacy criteria. Likewise, the indie camp wants *every* artist to be heard, not just those "verified" by a label— so they encourage the use of online tools that offer all the same benefits, for a small portion of one's time and energy.

But here's the problem: Once a mark of verification becomes easy to attain, it ceases to be an honest signal; we can no longer assume that those who have it are worth hearing from. Moreover, the field gets "polluted" by *dis*-honest signaling from the *least* worthy— that is, from opportunists who hustle to *get* the job, rather than simply *deserve* it. Seems bad, right? It's even worse…

You see, pollution is [an example](https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2012/09/24/prisoners-dilemma-and-the-environment/#:~:text=Using%20the%20example,end%20up%20polluting%29.) of the famous "prisoner's dilemma," where each player must decide: To squeal or not? Similarly, then, democratization requires each artist to decide: To hustle or not? We're all better off if *no one* hustles, of course. But once *anyone* does, they'll hog up all the attention. So now *every* artist must waste time and energy on the hustle!

To complicate matters, this is what's called a collective action problem: It's caused by individuals acting in their own interest— and so the solution *has* to come from top-down coordination. Yet the indie camp's way of thinking is bottom up; under their watch, change can *only* take place at the grassroots. Which means they'll never clean up this mess they've created…

The moral, then, is that low barriers to entry *don't* lead to democracy, but to "indieocracy"— namely, rule by those who hustle to get themselves known. So what happens now, if *your* dream all along was to be *made* known, by the elites? Why, you can verify your worth with BYCombo, by paying a steep *cost* of entry: a serious chunk of lifetime!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Audiences put to labor simply leave

Imagine this argument: "When I play sports, it doesn't just benefit *me*; it also benefits *you* to watch me. Yet I don't make minimum wage… while superstars earn millions! So let's get rid of overpaid talent scouts, and empower indie athletes like me to get ourselves known. Yes, this will crowd the field— but you'll just have to put in the work to find what you want. Who'd object?"

Uh… *we* would— the audience! Most of us only want the *best* athletes, and it's the *talent scout's* job to find them, not *ours*. If "indie sports" took over, then, we'd quietly turn to serial dramas or video games, and only ever come back for "classic sports" reruns. Right? Okay, well… indie rock *did* take over. So how come no one can figure out why the audience for music [is leaving](https://youtu.be/Ag4iFa6E_yY)?!

But there's hope: While Millennials were active creators from day one, Gen Z reverted to being passive consumers once the Internet consolidated. As with Boomers [and Gen X](http://archive.today/2021.05.21/https://genius.com/Nirvana-smells-like-teen-spirit-lyrics#:~:text=With%20the%20lights,now%2C%20entertain%20us), then, Gen Z empathizes foremost with the *audience*— having first been one themselves. Which means today's pro-artist thinking might just be a generational fluke… and *not* the future of music.

Still, how do we become pro-*audience* once more? First, we remind ourselves that, as a figure of speech, the word "audience" has strayed far from its literal meaning of "those who attend a work's performance." So let's use it in a way that Bach— who made music for God!— would've understood: An audience *isn't* a fanbase; nor are they a following.

From there, we admit that the silent majority only want the *best* artists— and *not* the job of knowing [what this entails](https://youtu.be/SYSa4RzaH80)! Fortunately, BYCombo promises to step up as an elitist gatekeeper, if you'll pledge to make the best art— which is to say, the kind of works that *you'd* care to study or enjoy most, if you were anyone else, out of all that's come before and all else that's out there.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Hustlers lack a theory of future minds

Nick Drake was ignored in his own time— yet the next generation made him known to history. Did they need to see him hustle? No, they judged his works! So there's a lesson here for all tastemakers: To discover an artist that future audiences will want to *re*-discover, simply… [think like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind) a future audience.

In the past, the major labels did just that: Their talent scouts would sign *any* artist on the strength of a stellar demo— even one with no fanbase, like Nick. Yet indie rock tells *every* artist to get themselves known… effectively saying they're each entitled to be. This, in turn, has killed off any notion that those who don't hustle could ever be *made* known— simply by deserving to be!

Let's imagine, though, that you *refuse* to be indie; you've hustled a few times, and it felt icky… like being a "pickup artist." Because, sure, it's a proven way to get fans— or dates!— but does society *want* this to be the case? Besides, most of us have now grown wise to being "negged"; sooner or later, then, won't we *also* wise up to, let's say, artists milking us for [free labor](https://exiledfan.substack.com/p/revenge-of-the-stans#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20easy%20to,Swifties%20Unionize%E2%80%9D%20prank.)?

So instead, you build yourself up into what a future audience— or romantic partner!— *would* want you to be, based on theories that you revise and refine over time. Which is also more fun and fulfilling for *you*, right? Yet from what I've seen… the indie tastemakers will never "forgive" your defiance. They're loyal to the hustlers— having hustled to get where they are themselves!

But why would the next generation side with past tastemakers who *didn't* care what they'd want, over past artists who *did*? In this light, they just might dismiss *all* of indie rock as disposable content! Luckily, BYCombo can make *your* art worthy of rediscovery— by letting you think like a future audience.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Welfare gets cut by past beneficiaries

Social welfare is straightforward, right? After giving us all a fair chance, the government taxes each of us at a rate proportionate to our success… which then subsidizes the same opportunities for the next generation. But welfare for artists is tricky, since— as we've seen— no government program is likely to give our history makers a fair chance.

So what *should* artistic welfare look like? Basically, a centralized institution must first cast a wide net, then take from the earnings of a successful few, to subsidize the same opportunities for the next generation of artists. But… this is how the major labels worked in their heyday, no? Promoting welfare in the arts, then, is simply the *smart* move— for any business with a profit motive!

Unfortunately, *all* welfare is fragile: Rather than be grateful to get a chance at all, the unsuccessful tend to resent not being given *more* support… while the successful often assume they'd have done just as well on their own, and thus resent "paying it forward." So those who sit on the *right*— including the indie camp's artistic conservatives— find it easy to turn the people against welfare.

Yet others *happily* pay it forward: "Paying more means we [succeeded more](http://archive.today/2025.06.26/https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/warren-buffett-greg-abel-succeeded-ceo-berkshire-1236316306/#:~:text=So%20thank%20you,They%20deserve%20better.)!" It's the noble way of thinking, for sure; but isn't it also better… for *you*? So if you miss those legacy institutions that promised to subsidize your chances— in exchange for *your* promise to do the same for others— BYCombo lets you find partners on the artistic *left*… who'll make the smart move once again.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Paid dues shrivel a noble spirit

Mr. Rogers told us to [look for the helpers](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/12135721-when-i-was-a-boy-and-i-would-see-scary) when times are bad. Now times are bad for music… so why is no one helping? Particularly from the indie camp— the "good guys"! As for me? Back in the day, I'd have *gladly* helped, what with all my ideas to revive the art form. But "noblesse oblige" wasn't mine to show; being a low-status nobody, I needed others to help *me* first. Yet no one did…

So I took a coding bootcamp, and for [seven years](https://bobtail.substack.com/p/zillow-farewell-message), I worked days as a coder and nights on my audio webcomic. When I came back to music, I once again heard artists speak of hustling as "paying our dues"— to justify, for instance, touring at a loss. Only this time it threw me, because in tech, paid dues are a sign of "fake work"— and outsiders who see this, disrupt cultures that don't.

Except… now it made sense why, [unlike the avant-garde](https://youtu.be/pHCdS7O248g) of the past, indie rock *doesn't* help the underclass to revive the art form! After all, if paid dues are worthless outside the one culture that honors them, then *of course* those who've paid them will now insist on keeping that culture as it is— no matter how broken it's become.

Moreover, once someone has wasted their best years striving for symbolic credentials rather than enviable talents, they can never feel secure enough to let others surpass them. So *of course* the only newcomers they'll help are those willing to waste even *more* potential. But these newcomers will then feel even *less* secure— thus widening the [vicious circle](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/391717-steve-jobs-has-a-saying-that-a-players-hire-a) of brokenness.

Which is why it took an outsider like myself to start BYCombo, driven by an urge to help future bands, like yours, surpass mine. My solution is so simple, I doubt I'm the first to think of it. Rather, I'm just secure enough to *want* it— having never hustled to pay indie rock's dues myself.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Hungry outsiders aim for the canon

"Who could've foreseen all the drawbacks of propagating indie rock's ideals?" Um… us women and minorities, that's who! If history's any guide, we *need* to be the best, just to be heard at all— and thus we *can't* be self-reliant. Rappers get this, which is why they rely on [labels and producers](http://archive.today/2024.05.11/https://genius.com/Dr-dre-nuthin-but-a-g-thang-lyrics#:~:text=Ain%27t%20nothin%27%20but,that%20pays%20me). Yes, they'll boast of having hustled— but it's to say, "I've got cred *too*… so yours means *nothing*."

Yet despite the poor fit, today's indie camp sure is eager to hand us the reins! Why? It's because "larping," or live-action role-playing, is only good enough when aiming for a *foreign* canon, not "the" canon— so after years of larping as an era-defining movement, indie rock has lost all cultural relevance. And now, we women and minorities are being nudged onto a "[glass cliff](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/glass-cliff.asp)"…

No thanks! Remember, the indie camp idolizes those like Stephen Malkmus and Jeff Mangum, whose privileges as society's underdogs allow them to live *devoid* of hunger. Yet rock and roll was founded by poor, queer Blacks, then carried further by rural Southerners, a Midwestern Jew, working-class Brits… In short, it's a history of outsiders, like us— and specifically, the *hungriest*.

Don't be fooled, then, by those who merely *larp* as history makers! All your instincts that stem from a *lack* of privilege— your hunger to be the best, and thus your need for mutual reliance— are *exactly* what it takes to aim for the historical canon. So come follow them, with BYCombo— the next movement after hip hop that's of, by, and for the under-*class*… not under-*dogs*.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Capitalism is the cure for cronyism

While being alternative is an *artistic* choice, being indie is a *business* stance. Until the '90s, then, "indie" [mainly referred](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=indie+band%2Cindie+label&year_start=1980&year_end=2000) to *labels*— not *artists*. And that stance? It says, "We *don't* do this for the money." Indeed, many indie labels started as a circle of friends who just wanted to support each other's bands— and this is how they still see themselves at heart. What's not to love? Well…

The issue is that these labels are run by society's most privileged groups— and to perpetuate inequality, the privileged *don't* need to harm others. They *only* need to [help their own](http://archive.today/2024.05.12/https://hbr.org/2014/01/white-people-do-good-things-for-one-another-and-thats-bad-for-hiring#:~:text=Whites%20don%E2%80%99t%20have,all%20the%20time.)— which is what any circle of friends will do! So indie rock's inequality can't be fixed at the root; its White male tastemakers just have to be more inclusive in whom they accept as their own.

But so far, their efforts have only helped women, not us minorities— or *male* minorities, anyway. Why? Because our struggles *aren't* the same. Minorities [face stereotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_content_model) of low *warmth*; and women, of low *competence*. Yet social justice, when self-enforced, *only* fixes misjudgments of competence; a circle of friends has every right to feel more warmly toward their own.

You'll notice, then, that we minorities *aren't* ones to begrudge a business partner their profit motive! To the contrary, making money for those who wouldn't otherwise warm to us has *always* been our ticket to acceptance— and [not *just* ours](https://www.eminem.com/song/white-america/#:~:text=When%20I%20was,under%20his%20ass). Now with BYCombo, this ticket can be yours once again.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Elitism is the great equalizer

While indie artists seek populist solidarity, rappers revel in [elitist snobbery](https://youtu.be/78SV9tguyVM). And yet, for Gen X, it's the *latter* who represent the true face of disadvantage! How so? Think about it: When millions want what few can have, competition *must* happen, one way or another— and with this being the case, those with no advantages would prefer it to happen in plain sight.

Because Millennials grew up with so many advantages, however, they fail to grasp how the *truly* disadvantaged behave in the face of competition— much like [being unskilled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect) keeps you from noticing greater skill in others. So when they see bands call for elitist gatekeeping the way rappers do, they decry it as "rockism"— implying that such snobbery is akin to racism.

But once competition takes place *away* from the public eye— as populism demands it should— the disadvantaged have no way to counter the hidden advantages of others: being born rich, having industry know-how or insider connections, benefiting from legacy institutions in the past… and so on. No wonder, then, that indie rock is [now a playground](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2316349-parent-names-are-blue-on-wikipedia) for the privileged!

Which explains why the disadvantaged tend to be *put off* by populism: It asks them to celebrate a [privileged artist's wins](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/an-open-letter-to-taylor-swift#:~:text=So%20who%20will,and%20have%20won!) as their own— while toppling the elites who represent their one hope to secure such wins themselves. And so we often get a "sideways horseshoe," in which the underclass at the bottom pulls closer to the elites at the top… and away from those in the middle.

Thankfully, *I've* never taken to indie rock's populist solidarity; as an Xennial and a minority, I much prefer hip hop's elitist snobbery— "rappism," maybe? Because, like it or not, public exposure *is* a zero-sum game. Now BYCombo lets you treat it as such… just like rockists and rappists always have.

### ${++sectionCounter}. True progressives join the establishment

In high school, a classmate referred to the carpetbaggers as "bad guys"— for having exploited the defeated South. This surprised me, since I saw them as "good guys"— for having defended vulnerable Blacks. Clearly, he sided with the people, while I sided with the elites and the underclass. So this model of a "sideways horseshoe" shows up not just in the arts… but in politics as well!

Now, our forebears didn't need to coin such a term; they intuitively grasped why the underclass should distrust populism— the [New Deal](https://wwnorton.com/books/When-Affirmative-Action-Was-White), anyone?— but we've since lost this intuition. As a result, progressive Millennials keep trying to pit *all* of us against the elites of the political establishment… only to watch in confusion as the disadvantaged among us [side with](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/2016-clinton-sanders-black-voters-pick-winner-n1029631) those elites instead.

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review.
`}

Of course, it's *also* in the arts where this confusion has caused such damage. As a minority, for example, I relate more to those working-class alternative bands of the '90s, who instinctively sought to partner with the major labels. Yet the college-educated indie camp— the supposed good guys— won't hear of it: "If *we* can afford not to sell out, then so can everyone else!"

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review.
`}

Which explains why both politics *and* the arts are getting worse in our times: In each case, Millennials keep mistaking populism for progressivism— when they're *not* the same! A populist *chastises* the disadvantaged for joining the establishment, whereas a progressive *sympathizes*… and thus joins as well, forgoing the urge to simply "larp" as a revolutionary.

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review.
`}

Because, in reality, it's only the *privileged* who can afford to be moral purists about selling out. So… might we get another sideways horseshoe? Regarding politics, I don't know enough to say; but in the arts, it's a definite yes! Thanks to BYCombo, you can once again overcome your disadvantage by joining the establishment— just like those alternative bands did in the '90s.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Countercultures shelter today's losers

Rappers love to bash the "wack MC"; as outsiders, they know that kindness to the audience means cruelty to worse artists. But the indie tastemakers *can't* be cruel; they're "good guys"! So rather than weed you out for being wack— a harsh indictment of who you *are*— they merely dismiss you as a hobbyist if you didn't hustle— a plain measure of whether you've paid your dues.

Yet as W. David Marx observes in his book [*Status and Culture*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/659558/status-and-culture-by-w-david-marx), every culture creates its own status hierarchy. Which means the one created by indie rock *isn't* the same as that of its predecessor— the alternative culture from which Radiohead emerged. There are new winners, but also new losers… such as "hobbyists," who now sit at the bottom.

And this should concern us, since Radiohead… were the ultimate hobbyists! They'd never hustled in their *lives*. Upon signing to a major label based on a stellar demo, they were told to change their name from [On a Friday](https://radiohead.fandom.com/wiki/On_a_Friday)— and they *did*, to no confusion, as they were so little known in their local scene. There just wasn't any recourse: The indie labels didn't want them!

"But can't *today's* indies learn to sign the *next* Radiohead?" No… See, status plays out unconsciously; no one *conspires* to enforce its hierarchy— so there are no minds to change. Our human nature is simply to *admire* whichever traits enable whomever to win, by whatever the rules are… and if the rule is to get yourself known, then the winning trait is a knack for the hustle.

Still, the losers have one recourse: to start a *counter*-culture… that just might let them be [*tomorrow's* winners](http://archive.today/2024.05.11/https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/times-they-are-changin/#:~:text=For%20the%20loser,are%20a%2Dchangin%E2%80%99)! Yet none has arisen, because: "Why counter the good guys?" Fortunately, as this century's biggest loser, I've spent half my life plotting to start one. Now with BYCombo, you too can hope for amnesty, after betting it all on the craft— your low-status "hobby."

### ${++sectionCounter}. Independence breeds homogeneity

"Be so good they [can't ignore you](https://youtu.be/jTdXqsrs4oI)," Steve Martin advises. Well… I thought I'd done just that, given the scope of my projects— including [amnesticism](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/23566), my theory for composing multidimensional works. Yet every indie tastemaker I've met with has written me off as a hobbyist… despite *seeming* impressed. So I used to wonder: Shouldn't *one* have given me a chance by now?

Then one day it clicked: I *haven't* met with a hundred such tastemakers. For all intents and purposes, I've only ever met with the same one— a hundred times over! After all, being independent means having no weaknesses, and thus no real strengths. Consequently, everyone in indie rock converges on the same well-rounded way of thinking…

Moreover, just like each person gets one vote in a democracy, each work gets one chance in an "indieocracy." So artists converge on the same strategy of putting out many on a steady basis, leading them all to make the same *kind* of work— namely, "workhorse art." Yet the indie labels don't mind; since they sign just one artist at a time, a well-rounded one is the safe bet *every* time!

Still… what if *your* dream is to make "windfall art," which *requires* you to be exceptionally strong in the ways of art, and thus hopelessly weak in matters of business? Then let BYCombo help you meet partners who are as lopsided as you, but the other way around— because they value interdependence as much as you do!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Interdependence guards against prejudice

Indie rock's ideals are based on *ethics*, not *aesthetics*— and ethics transcend time. So why couldn't rock be "indiefied" from the *beginning*? Imagine, then, that we go back in time to the '50s and announce, "Artists, as your own best advocate, you'll now be judged on self-reliance— that is, on how well you get *yourself* known, without a partner's help. The playing field is finally level!"

Every Black artist would stare glumly at us. Why? Because, back then, they *needed* White partners to advocate on their behalf. Indie rock's rules would work like an artistic poll tax, shutting them out in *effect*— without admitting to this *intent*. By indiefying rock in the '50s, then… we'd look like racists. But this *wasn't* our intent! So where did we go wrong?

It's simple: Historically, victims of prejudice relied on a centralized judiciary to *subvert* the people's will. During the civil rights movement, for example, the federal government had to force the Southern states to [end segregation](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/may/06/ruby-bridges-the-six-year-old-who-defied-a-mob-and-desegregated-her-school). But indie rock promises to *obey* the people's will by *de*-centralizing the arts— which means it'll always uphold the prejudices of its times.

Well, is society free of prejudice today? Of course not. Yet no one noticed me staring glumly when indie rock took over… So what happens now, if *your* life experiences, like mine, have shown that you *aren't* your own best advocate? Why, BYCombo can restore your artistic civil rights— by letting you partner with elites who'll advocate on your behalf!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Identity is a resort of the privileged

Let's be fair, in wanting to be judged on the self-reliance that comes easily to them, White men *don't* know they're trading on their privilege; they really *do* think it helps all of us. But this is why they *didn't* blame their own ideals when "nepo babies"— for whom it's even *easier*!— took the lead in the '00s. Instead, they leaned harder on their identities as [society's underdogs](http://archive.today/2021.06.04/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/magazine/black-keys-blues.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFor%20me%2C%20it,aspirations%20we%20did.%E2%80%9D).

Except… it turns out, this *too* is a hidden advantage that's largely theirs alone! By the '10s, then, indie rock was overwhelmingly White and male. Suffering a [crisis of conscience](https://slate.com/culture/2012/08/pitchforks-peoples-list-is-almost-exclusively-white-and-male-this-is-a-scandal.html), the indie camp solved this problem in the only way they knew how: by letting us women and minorities self-identify as underdogs as well— a solution that's come to be called "wokeness."

But while White men *easily* gain from their identities without admitting to it— as when it [lends authenticity](http://archive.today/2023.12.13/https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15551-bon-iver/#:~:text=The%20guy%20who,write%20some%20songs) to a "larpy" backstory— we women and minorities can do so only by *blatantly* pointing to our race or gender… for which society *doesn't* feel the same affection! So wokeness has provoked a backlash, as MAGA now attacks it from the political right.

Yet such attacks are doomed to fail. How do I know? Because, when the indie labels first rejected me in the '00s, I *myself* flirted with joining the right— to snub the indie camp, who mostly sit on the political left. But I couldn't get my arguments to line up… until it hit me: Greater *indie*-pendence is a demand of the *right*; in terms of the *arts*, it's *I* who sit on the left— and *they*, the right!

So if seeking to gain from one's identity— one's *self*, if you will— is the logical next step once there's no more to be gained from self-*reliance*… then it *too* is an ideal of the right, held mainly by the privileged! Well, what if your demand was *never* for wokeness, but for greater *inter*-dependence— to be self-*less*, as it were? Then come join BYCombo… and help to revive the artistic left!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Penultimate tolerance retracts a lifeline

No, Silents weren't rooting for a Black crooner… but this is *exactly* why they embraced Sammy Davis Jr.! They knew he had only one lifeline, like every hungry outsider before him: to try much harder, to be much better than all others. He did just that— so they kept their end of the bargain. Similarly, we Xennials didn't want a White rapper… but then we embraced Eminem.

Yet when I came along— trying much harder, to be much better— no indie tastemaker grasped that I was making the same age-old plea: "Judge me *apart* from my identity!" Why? I suspect it's because Millennials were the first generation to believe they'd achieved perfect tolerance; as such, they declared society's bargain with the hungry outsider to be null and void.

Thus I had *no* lifeline… and then, as it happens, Millennials *weren't* perfectly tolerant. Which is why indie rock was largely White and male for so long! Yet even in a *perfectly* tolerant future, we'll *still* find underdogs to favor, based on "safe" criteria like [place of origin](https://x.com/Steven_Hyden/status/1708868954741977173). For a clear conscience, then, we *must* toss a lifeline to the rest— whom we've now made *worse* off in this zero-sum game.

There's also a selfish reason to do so: Once we shut out the outsiders of our times, we can no longer deflect any claim that the arts declined under our watch— a claim that history will surely make against Millennials! Luckily, if you're hungry enough to try much harder, to be much better, BYCombo can help Gen Z honor that age-old bargain once more.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Underdogs are supremacists in effect

Perhaps my arguments against indie rock seem moot, now that "poptimism" has defeated "rockism." After all, doesn't this mean that pop killed rock? Well, no; the *real* killer was "indiefication." Unaware of their complicity, however, many in the indie camp then sought to be of use elsewhere. So poptimism… is really just indie rock's good intentions brought to the pop genre!

Ignore the superficial differences in sound: Indie rock and poptimism are both underdog movements that supplanted a previous culture founded by outsiders. For the former, it was rock and roll, whose lineage traces to Sister Rosetta Tharpe; and for the latter, the classic pop defined by Tin Pan Alley's Jewish immigrants.

Both movements protect the chosen underdog by refusing to ask: "Wouldn't the hungry outsider— who tries much harder, to be much better— take us *farther*?" But if an underdog *isn't* the best of our times, then they'll also need history to *remember* them as the underdog. Yet future generations will know of every advantage they were given that was denied to the outsider!

This… *can't* be a viable way to make history. Because, what notable figures from *our* past require the same cognitive dissonance of *us*? I can only think of the Ku Klux Klan and their ilk— America's original underdogs, who fought to suppress America's [original outsiders](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9648466-you-ve-got-to-be-twice-as-good-to-get-half)! Which doesn't bode well for indie rock's legacy… or poptimism's future…

Yet underdog movements will never go away, because to be treated as an underdog is a *privilege*… and the privileged can always find ways to benefit themselves. But what if you're *not* whom the people want to root for? Then let BYCombo throw you a lifeline, by bringing back rockism— rock and roll's original spirit, courtesy of its [founding underclass](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/12348736-oh-these-kids-and-rock-and-roll-this-is)!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Fair practices follow the numbers

Since the indie camp measures artistry by paid dues— and "poptimists," by popularity— both see a natural ally in the tech platforms, who work best with objective metrics such as these. So every new technology in the '00s— digital downloads, streaming media, crowdfunding— was really about bringing the good intentions of underdog movements to the Internet!

After all, here's how it worked before: Each major label would bet on visions that others *didn't* see— like, let's say, a regional style blowing up all over the world. But this left bands powerless to negotiate; they couldn't play one label off another, since a vision alone is worth nothing. As a result, they often had to accept unfair terms… leading many to [resent the majors](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-music) as "bad guys."

By contrast, the indie labels simply pick what the people want, going by the size of an artist's fanbase. Once *anyone* sees a safe bet, then, *everyone* does… and now all that's left is for one label to outbid the rest by offering the most generous terms. In other words, the way to do *right* by artists— and thus to be rated as a "good guy"— is to trust those objective metrics!

So when the tech platforms arrived to disrupt the majors using data-driven methods, the indie camp was *fully* on board. I still recall how they rushed to defend file sharing: "Real artists earn a living by going on tour. Recordings are just for publicity; they *should* be free!" And social networks: "Real artists engage with their fans after a show— and now they can at *any* time!"

To sum up, it was the *indie camp* who gave us today's [data-driven industry](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/17/steve-albini-at-face-the-music-how-the-internet-solved-problem-with-music)! Thanks to them— and their grievances— even the *majors* [behave like](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/record-labels-dig-their-own-grave#:~:text=Record%20labels%20have%20lost,record%20labels%20anymore.) indies now, by forcing you to empower yourself using online tools. The only way to revolt, then, is to reject indie rock *itself*. This is why BYCombo tells you *not* to boost your numbers… but to pursue a vision that few others see.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Unenlightened romanticism is a dark age

Are we headed for a new Romanticism? Some foresee a [rebellion brewing](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/28/new-romanticism-technology-backlash) against science, as algorithms take over the arts. And yet, algorithms simply reflect what the people want, just like word of mouth does; it's why indie rock defended them for as long as it did. In this light, then, maybe we *shouldn't* be upset with the algorithms, but rather with *ourselves*— the people!

As stated earlier, we humans dislike creative ideas… but we're *also* biased against the underclass who generates them! And [when in doubt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimetic_theory), we look to others… yet they *share* our status-based prejudices! So the research is clear: Creative ideas *must* be spread from the top down, by the elites— who alone feel a "noblesse oblige" to help those being *hurt* by our human nature.

Yet indie rock told us to do *away* with elitism: "Any good idea is *sure* to spread from the bottom up… by *us*." Which is to say, we've been scoffing at science— while "larping" as Romantics— all along! In fact, this is why it was so *easy* for the algorithms to take over: The tech platforms just had to speak of "freeing the human spirit" or "obeying the people's will," and we fell for it every time.

So yes, the arts have declined— but it *isn't* because the tech platforms listen to science; it's because the indie camp *doesn't*! The only way forward, then, is a new *Enlightenment*, by which we finally work with our human nature as the research says it is, not as we wish it to be— for the first time this century. And if you join BYCombo… you can help to usher it in.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Startups offer lessons in scalability

In indie rock, a fanbase is built from the bottom up, one fan at a time. So I was often asked, "How do you expect *Yearling's Bobtail* to gain a *million* fans, when no one wants to be its *first*?" "Well, it's my *Ulysses*," I'd reply. "Surely an unknown James Joyce would've faced the same dilemma?" I just didn't have a better answer… until my years as a coder exposed me to startup culture.

Within the past few decades, we've come to learn that startups are uniquely positioned to innovate because of [how they grow](https://paulgraham.com/growth.html#:~:text=That%20difference%20is,from%20the%20beginning.): Unlike a retail store, which can't scale into a chain if it's unprofitable, a startup with few users might lose money on each user— yet *still* hope to turn a profit upon gaining millions of them! How? Through network effects and economies of scale.

Well, this *also* explains how an artist like me— who can't even gain *one* fan— might still hope to gain a *million*! When your lyrics are [hopelessly dense](https://yearlingsbobtail.com/2-willy-the-cocoa/?verse=1&annotation=4), a listener will parse them only if others have done the same: network effects! And when your parts are [hopelessly complex](https://yearlingsbobtail.com/2-willy-the-cocoa/?verse=37&annotation=45), new bandmates won't commit to fully learning them until an audience is guaranteed: economies of scale!

Now here's another point: Having scaled by opening one store at a time, a retail chain *can't* pivot to behaving like a startup. What if, having gained one fan at a time, an indie artist can't pivot to making dense and complex works? What if such works— if they're to be made at all— can *only* be made by those whose dream all along was to gain a million fans at *once*, from the top down?

If so, this explains why those in tech now dominate the arts: While investors *readily* fund startups that lose money, the indie tastemakers *refuse* to believe in artists with no fanbase! But now, BYCombo puts you in a unique position to innovate, by letting you dream that millions would gladly be your *millionth* fan— even as none want to be your *first*.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Strivers don't know they're not dreamers

Whenever I used to grumble about getting rejected by the indie tastemakers, friends would ask, "So why don't you *seriously* hustle?" Fair point! Why *didn't* I? I suspect it's because, for Xennials like myself, being an artist was a vision to *dream* about. Once indie rock took over, however, it became a goal to *strive* for. And as a dreamer… I didn't know I wasn't a striver.

See, us dreamers, we're not grounded in reality— which makes our visions hard to fulfill. Naturally, then, it was assumed that we'd gain the most from indie rock's promise of self-empowerment. But… I wasn't prepared for what would follow; I didn't realize a new generation of strivers was about to raise the bar for hustling. So, like a child, I thought I'd get points just for trying.

Yet it's *because* the dreamer is unrealistic that their vision, if ever fulfilled, might change the world in ways a striver's goal never can. And this is what *Millennials* don't realize— being strivers themselves. Which is why they *also* fail to see how past generations of dreamers raised the bar for innovation… such that, now, they think they'll get points just for trying!

But all is assumed to be well, since today's artists easily look and sound like the innovators of yesteryear… while we're never shown what *true* innovation in our times would entail. Still, what if *you're* here to truly innovate— and not just to "larp" the idea of doing so? Then keep on dreaming, like a child, and let BYCombo help you find the perfect partner: a striver!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Scarcity teaches generational courage

Combining glam's gender-bending look with metal's aggression, glam metal was the ideal youth movement— for a *previous* generation. But as for Gen X… they saw it as a relic. Well, guess what was no less outdated by the '00s? Indie rock's rule for artists to hustle! Yet Millennials adopted it as their own… even *after* I warned them. Why were they glad to simply "larp" the next revolution?

Here's what I mean: If you *don't* hustle, the indie camp will reject you. But you should *want* to double down on making art instead— plus, getting punished for breaking their rule means that history will see your act as courageous. So it's one way *not* to larp… *and* a twofer! Who *wouldn't* jump on it? *I* did— and as an Xennial, what did *I* know of courage? Yet no Millennials joined me. Why?

I'll tell you my theory: Millennials only faced boredom long enough to hate it; then, before they could learn to daydream, they were given structured ways to create and consume endless content— which [won their gratitude](https://xkcd.com/1601). And so they never realized what was obvious: The only rules left that take courage to break… are the *structural* ones— like indie rock's— that *they* help to enforce!

Yet my warning remains valid: "Indie rock is this generation's *glam metal*, not *alternative*." Except, today, the generation in question is *Gen Z*— who've only ever faced an [*abundance* of content](http://archive.today/2022.12.16/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/15/style/teens-social-media.html)… and would now *love* to revolt! Well, this Xennial offers a solution: With BYCombo, you can show courage once again— by doubling down to make art, for a serious chunk of lifetime.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Unity brutalizes the lone scapegoat

Back when content was scarce, joining a scene— goth, punk— was a full-time effort; it meant rejecting the rest. This taught Gen X to stand fiercely for their side… knowing that others are still [good people](https://web.archive.org/web/2012/http://www.mitchclem.com/nothingnice/196). Now for Millennials, it's the other way around: Each scene is just an "era" to try on— but any threat to the structures that allow for such "larping"… must be fiercely opposed by *all*.

Furthermore: "If 99% of us can see we're all in this together, then you'd best believe the other 1% is *that* awful. Still, we can beat them on size alone!" So Millennials never learned to disagree, but instead to [hold out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_are_the_99%25) for a crushing majority— leading political progressives to unite with right-wing populists against the left's elites! And in the arts, it's the same muddled thinking…

Let's say an indie artist hustles to build a fanbase on their own, thus making themselves more attractive to the labels. The pro-artist crowd cheers, right? Okay. Now imagine that the same labels reject *another* artist, for *not* having an existing fanbase. This time the crowd boos. Except… the former scenario *causes* the latter, doesn't it? So how are the *labels* to blame?!

Look… either it's an advantage to hustle, or it *isn't* a disadvantage not to. You *can't* want both; they're opposite outcomes! Yet when I pointed this out in the '00s… no one backed me up. Worse, by threatening their delusion that artists can— and thus *should*— be united, I became that 1% for the other 99% to beat down… like the brutalized child in Ursula Le Guin's [fictional utopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas).

Thankfully, some of you now *agree* with me that music has since declined… and you'd like to walk away from this delusion of pro-artist unity! But where to? Why, you can join us at BYCombo, and stand fiercely for the artistic *left*… knowing that those on the *right*— the indie camp— are still good people.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Music recording is its own medium

Now that content is abundant, the new Romantics long for a return to live shows. Yet shows are fleeting by nature… just like content! It's why the best live performers, like content creators, strive to *consistently* deliver; theirs is the ultimate "workhorse art." And music needs that! But who'll deliver this generation's "windfall art"— which calls for betting it all on a *single* chance?

To make *Pet Sounds*, Brian Wilson pushed the studio to its limits, never once considering how the album now seen as his masterpiece might be recreated live. As home studios grew affordable in the '00s, then, I foresaw a revival in which hundreds of unknown artists would take the art of music recording to new heights, each by making a [stellar demo](https://yearlingsbobtail.com/6-ash-wednesday/?verse=10&annotation=17)— and so I set to [work on mine](https://yearlingsbobtail.com/16-cremated/?verse=1&annotation=4).

Upon completion five years later, *Yearling's Bobtail* caught the attention of a few indie labels. Success! I put together a band, and we played a show for one of them. It was… admittedly sloppy, given that my new bandmates still hadn't fully learned their parts. The label founder left in a huff and stopped replying to my emails, later sneering at "headphone albums" on his blog.

Thus I learned indie rock's founding belief: "Live shows tell the truth." Yet if recordings capture what shows can't… then this is an *asset*, not a *liability*! They're two distinct mediums— like cinema versus theatre. So ignore those who insist that "real" artists start out by playing shows. With BYCombo, you can make a stellar demo… with no thought for how you'll recreate it live.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Modern collaboration requires assembly

Demos allow artists to pursue visions they *can't* fulfill on their own, and one vision much in need of a partner's help today is… forming a rock band at all! Because, who'd want to be *anyone's* bandmate, let alone *yours*— given all the perks of being a lone content creator, in a world that now favors pop? Some ask why bands have [largely disappeared](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-bands-are-never-coming-back), but it's really no mystery.

Here's my point: Suppose an indie label were willing to sign me *before* my band was formed. With the assurance of being signed, I could then convince the most dedicated musicians to join me. Clearly, this wouldn't just benefit *me*, but also the *label*, right? And by rethinking how bands might form, we'd see a resurgence of them! Yet the indies can't rethink *anything*…

Luckily, having struggled for half my life to attract bandmates, I anticipated that the best musicians would gradually prefer to be *assembled* into bands— and that this, in turn, could open up a new frontier to explore! So relax, and focus all your efforts on simply *deserving* the most dedicated bandmates… secure in the knowledge that BYCombo will then help you find them.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Advances are made in aesthetics, not logistics

When's it a "larp"? Here's a test: Could it've been a fictional movie *instead*? Let's say, a fictional Queen… How would you commission the soundtrack?! So, Queen: no larp. "Well then, isn't it *also* no larp for an indie artist to hustle, if they're using an app that disrupted the industry too *soon* to make sense in a movie?" Okay, fair enough. But in that case, isn't the *real* hero… the app?

In music history courses, we learn that the evolution of the piano allowed Beethoven to compose sonatas of unprecedented [range and dynamics](https://www.cpr.org/2020/09/19/he-wanted-larger-and-louder-the-pianos-of-beethovens-time-werent-enough-for-him). By contrast, it's hardly mentioned that the invention of lithography allowed his scores to be sold to the middle class. In other words, music historians take note of technology when it advances the *art form*— not the *supply chain*.

Unlike what the indie camp believes, then, music history *won't* care how the Internet empowered artists to hustle. But what if they were assembled into bands, allowing them to combine mediums in unprecedented ways? At long last… they'd be the real heroes! So come join BYCombo, and explore *another* frontier— by having a dancer, illustrator, or puppeteer as your bandmate.

### ${++sectionCounter}. A renaissance of elders awaits

Beethoven composed his [magnum opus](https://youtu.be/4IqnVCc-Yqo) in the final years of his life— and he was no exception: The best composers got *better* with age. But this still isn't the case with rock bands— which means there's yet *another* frontier left to explore! So if you're a Millennial, don't fret: You still have a lifetime to give *future* generations the renaissance that indie rock denied to *yours*.

In her book [*Generations*](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Generations/Jean-M-Twenge/9781982181611), Jean Twenge notes that young folks are reaching key milestones *later* in life, because society in *general* is now more complex; thus more time is needed to fulfill your potential. But this must also be true for the arts in *particular*— which explains how Millennials got off track there: Indie rock taught them to hustle… and hustling makes you burn out *sooner*.

By contrast, a deep love of the craft can motivate you for a lifetime. After all, to take on greater challenges, you must build your talents further— and to build your talents further, you must take on greater challenges… onward and upward, in a virtuous circle. So if you're burned out by the hustle, BYCombo can get you back on track— by helping you stay in love with your craft.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Happiness flows from the act of creation

At the peak of my years working eighty-hour weeks— forty to earn a living, and forty on my own projects— a friend staged an intervention. "On a scale of one to ten," he asked, "how happy are you?" "Eight," I replied. He was floored; he'd expected a three. And so I cleared up the matter: The very reason I chose this unusual path was to *guarantee* my happiness.

In his book [*Flow*](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/flow-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi), Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi points out that when you have a clear goal; feel adequately challenged; and get immediate feedback from the task at hand, you become fully immersed in the act of creation— which leads to long-term fulfillment. This explains how my years of sacrifice were some of my happiest; I *wasn't* slowly killing myself, as my friend had feared.

Meanwhile, there's a [mental health crisis](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/music-and-mental-health) in music today, with artists facing high levels of anxiety and depression. Why? Because any exposure gained from decades of hustling might just as well be won by chance, bought with privilege, or stolen through opportunism— in an instant. Every artist knows this, yet they play by indie rock's rules anyway… and it eats at their soul.

Yes, the struggle can be a gift— but only when you face it on your own terms. If you're forced to use the same tools as everyone else… then it's a *grind*. This is why BYCombo tells you to focus on your craft, and to join a community of peers who'll do the same. It isn't *just* to make your art better; it's *also* for your happiness— and the good of your soul.

Indie rock's individualism can't build for the future. It isn't future oriented. Can't solve collective action problems.

Interdependent labels pool their rosters.

* To be indie is to be, literally, *self*-ish. Individualists are loyal to no one but themselves, and the indie camp admires them for it.

Culturally progressive alternative.

* Protectionism

* Great Man theory of history?

* Fixed mindset?

* Having an authentic persona, staying true to who you are, how things were done in the past. Do mention both "authentic" and "persona."

* to be independent, I don't need you, but you also don't need me

* Indie mentality that you have high agency as an individual

First paragraph


Second paragraph
A movement that emphasizes self-sacrifice for the sake of the collective is the only way to solve collective action problems.

AI simply takes further indie rock's ideal of the self-interested individual triumphing over the collective. It might as well stand for "accelerated indiefication"!

As such, it's not enough to return to the ideals of the '00s— the golden years, according to Millennials— back when the collective action problems created by indie rock weren't yet known to be such. We must return to the ideals of the 20th century— the golden decades, according to us Xennials and everyone older— before those collective action problems even started.

Net givers versus net takers.

Conclusion

Preceding section:
Yes, the struggle can be a gift— but only when you face it on your own terms. If you're forced to use the same tools as everyone else… then it's a *grind*. This is why BYCombo tells you to focus on your craft, and to join a community of peers who'll do the same. It isn't *just* to make your art better; it's *also* for your happiness— and the good of your soul.

Individualism in a sea of collectivism. Collectivist movement in a sea of individualism.

Talk about anti-vax. Herd immunity.

Mention persona.

To be great means missing out on most things. This is intolerable for individualists.

Collectivists pool their experiences, allowing them *not* to see it all, or do it all.

Let's face it, history makers will be low status for the indefinite future. A collectivist mindset is the only way that low status is tolerable.

Mention entitlement.

To rebel against soulless AI content, the new Romantics call for a revival of indie art. Yet AI simply empowers the individual, allowing many more to consider themselves artists, by shifting the advantage to those who put out many more works, for far less effort— the very same thing that indie rock did to a landscape that once favored interdependent bands.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Consequentialists care about impact

In his book [*The Nineties*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557048/the-nineties-by-chuck-klosterman), Chuck Klosterman observes that Gen X didn't reject *capitalism*, just *commercialism*. That is to say: "You can *sell*, but don't sell *out*." Still, indie rock told Millennials to take it further: "Sell it *yourself*." Which they did… until the hustle burned them out. Yet, rather than blame "indiefication," they now rail against the need to sell at all— or, capitalism *itself*!

As a result, Millennials *readily* sell out, insisting that survival today depends on it— even as they retain the [core belief](https://bennettsamuellin.blogspot.com/2013/06/unjamming-next-generation.html#:~:text=For%20Generation%20X,who%20you%20are.) underlying a *refusal* to do so: "Who you *are* matters more than what you get *done*." But this contradiction gives us the *worst* of both worlds, in which artists brazenly boost their numbers— while we're told to cheer them on, for being the underdogs they are!

Meanwhile, '90s alternative bands like Nirvana gave us the *best* of both: They wrestled with being sellouts, yet signed with major labels all the same— thus inspiring us Xennials to ditch our *own* individualist concerns for identity, in favor of a collectivist one for impact. So what happened? Millennials are too young to remember: The indie camp [branched off](https://www.avclub.com/part-6-1995-live-bush-and-alanis-morissette-take-th-1798223405#:~:text=The%20difference%20between,post%2Dgraduate%20twentysomethings.) to *oppose* such bands.

Then indie rock took over in the '00s… and now faces no opposition in turn. After all, it's the first rock movement based on *ethics*, not *aesthetics*— which means history neither shows us how to rebel… nor even says that we *should*. And with ethics being central to one's identity, Millennials have long insisted that we *shouldn't*— to the detriment of our impact.

Still, since our troubles began when we accepted indiefication and rejected capitalism… why not accept *capitalism* now, and reject *indiefication*? Yes, this will debase who you *are*, as the indie camp sees it— but so did leaving for the majors in the '90s! Besides, history only remembers what you get *done*— as [Kurt Cobain](http://archive.today/2022.10.12/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/nirvana-inside-the-heart-and-mind-of-kurt-cobain-103770/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20don%E2%80%99t%20blame,identity%20so%20righteously.%E2%80%9D) knew. Now BYCombo lets you act on this knowledge as well.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Solutions come from systems thinking

Why is progressivism so badly beaten in both politics and the arts today? It's because indie rock taught us all to take down the "system" and its elites— but this only works out for libertarians, who aren't looking to replace the system with any other; decentralization is their end goal. We progressives, however, *depend* on centralized institutions to promote the welfare we want.

So the anti-elitists among us topple the system by joining with libertarians… who then resist their efforts to build a new one… which must now be morally perfect to survive. But— surprise!— these new builders will then prove to be no less flawed than those they replaced. Because of this, they'll get toppled as well… in an endless test of [moral purity](https://youtu.be/qaHLd8de6nM) that no one can pass.

In other words, the popular model of an "[upside-down horseshoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory)," in which anti-elitists on the left align with those on the right… holds true *only* during the "breaking" phase! Once the "building" phase begins, our best chance as progressives— whether political or artistic— is to *work* with our side's elites.

Which means we'll [need to quit](https://jasonpargin.substack.com/p/is-modern-mass-media-a-mind-prison#:~:text=The%20reality%20is,to%20peacefully%20cooperate.) "larping" as revolutionaries— that is, to quit equating virtue with *identity*, rather than with *impact*— and instead, master the skills needed to analyze our problems and propose solutions. But how? Beyond acknowledging the messiness of our human nature… we must also appreciate systems in all their complexity.

So if I could get every progressive— in both politics and the arts— to read just one book, it would be [*Thinking in Systems*](https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/thinking-in-systems) by Donella Meadows, who shows us how to understand systems in terms of their connections and feedback loops. It's what led to many of the insights that shaped BYCombo's mission… and hopefully, it can lead to some of your own!

### ${++sectionCounter}. The simplest explanation is likely correct

To explain the squiggles traversed by the planets in their orbits around the Earth, ancient astronomers mapped out a convoluted model of epicycles. But then Copernicus proposed that the planets actually revolve around the *Sun*— turning these squiggles into circles. This was a [simpler explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)… so over time, it became accepted as the correct one.

Well, music today requires a pretty convoluted explanation, doesn't it? After all, indie artists are widely believed to deliver the boldest art… yet *none* can rival what the major labels gave us in their heyday?! And now the majors *themselves* [behave like](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/nine-predictions-for-the-future-of#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20why%20record,as%20indie%20operators.) indie labels, by only signing artists who *don't* need a label… yet this *hasn't* led to the next Nirvana or Radiohead?!

Let's ditch old beliefs, then, and think in systems: If an artist diverts 5% of their effort toward *getting* the job, away from simply *deserving* it, they alone reap the benefit— even as this erodes the public's faith in music *overall*! So others will do the same… leading to a "tragedy of the commons." But now, 5% is our *baseline*… and soon, 10%… 15%… as we "[drift to low performance](https://donellameadows.org/archives/drift-to-low-performance/#:~:text=People%20summon%20the,possible%20any%20more.)."

With this being the case, shouldn't we expect "indiefication" to make music… *worse*? Whoa— everything lines up now! Yet the indie camp will oppose this simpler explanation… so BYCombo won't get far by merely proposing it. To gain acceptance, interdependence could still use some advocacy. Will you join with the Bobtail Yearlings, then, and be a Galileo of music?

### ${++sectionCounter}. Art needs the passion of martyrs

"Where's *our* Nirvana?" It's a question asked by today's young folks. And hey— there's an easy way to answer it: Can we imagine the *next* generation asking of any band today, "Where's *our* _____?" If so, then _____ is *this* generation's Nirvana. Of course, we can't— because this generation never got their own Nirvana. Except… why *didn't* they?

It's because we only pine for past artists who self-sacrificed to advance the art form— and future audiences will feel the same way. But since indie rock *protects* artists from exploitation, it favors those who *empower* themselves instead. For this reason, artists today demand fair compensation; they don't do *anything* that reeks of being exploited— *especially* self-sacrifice.

Yet self-empowerment comes with its own set of problems. For one, it's just [power-seeking](http://archive.today/2022.10.26/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/arts/music/ryan-adams-women-sex.html), [self-serving](https://pitchfork.com/news/arcade-fires-win-butler-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-by-multiple-women-frontman-responds) behavior in those we see as underdogs; it's not noble in and of itself. For another, artists with this trait hold the *advantage*— so how are *they* the underdogs? But worst of all, it ensures that indie rock's structural rules, which promise fair compensation, can *never* be broken.

If rock is to be saved, then, we *must* give amnesty to those who self-sacrifice for art's sake. Yes, by needing business partners, they leave themselves open to exploitation— and by siding with elitist gatekeepers, they incur the wrath of *middling* artists. But once the art form declines, what's left to protect? So after Empowerment… comes the Age of Martyrdom.

Let's never go back to the days of artists dying young, of course. Thankfully, history tells of another kind of martyr: those who sacrificed not their *lives*, but [serious chunks](https://www.nelsonmandela.org/biography) of *lifetime*. Well, what if the next Nirvana is an entire *movement* of selfless bands doing just that? If so, then join us at BYCombo— and help give the next generation a Nirvana of their own!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Artists want faith in a savior

Let's return to the original question: How has indie rock made music worse? In summary, past artists grew up believing that, in time, they could partner with elites who'd advocate for them by spreading their works from the top down. And thus secure in this faith, they built up the "one-to-*n*" talents that gave us "[Reason to Believe](https://youtu.be/dUWZw8uDak4)"… and "[Both Sides, Now](https://youtu.be/J48BpiPLHtA?t=1989)"… and "[Superstar](https://youtu.be/SJmmaIGiGBg)"…

But thanks to "indiefication," today's artists have no such reason to believe. So they spread their works from the bottom up, hoping for one to catch on with the crowd— which, these days, means going viral. In doing so, however, they end up building "zero-to-one" talents instead, leading to a different *kind* of work— a difference many of us hear, even if we can't articulate it.

"Is it *worse*, though?" Yes, insofar as it won't *last*. Remember, historians are *elites*; they don't *need* to obey the people's will. If they *want* to advocate for Joni Mitchell, now, it's because she made it easy for potential partners back then to feel the same. But when artists are being discovered by the crowd… well, who wouldn't just leave them to be *re*-discovered this way as well?

Today's music is worse, then, because it's bottom up— while history *itself* is top down. Sadly, just like "fish don't know they're wet," Millennials and Gen Z don't know these are bottom-up times. Which means the revolution *must* be started by us Xennials, who recall a top-down past. So come join BYCombo, and build up your one-to-*n* talents… in faith that a savior will then find you!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Victory is assured

Once indie rock's ideals take root, they end up taking over. After all, with so many artists to choose from, what label *wouldn't* prefer the one who already does the middleman's job? What fan *wouldn't* prefer the one who engages with them by asking for [free labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Franklin_effect)? And what critic *wouldn't* prefer the one whose well-constructed "lore" offers so much context to discuss?

Meanwhile, by refusing to be indie, an interdependent band can't compete on *any* of those terms! All they can do is promise to make better art— but by itself, this convinces no one. Because, how *much* better are we talking about? Fortunately, we can turn to the Pareto principle, which states that 20% of the effort yields 80% of the results.

Now, since indie artists do it all themselves, they must put in a further 80% effort to get that last 20% in results, right? So, 100% results for 100% effort. Interdependent bands, however, play to their strengths by having *partners* cover their weaknesses— which lets them put 20% effort into getting 80% results, over and over. Well, added up… that's *400%* results!

Let's call this the "4x law of interdependence," then: By allowing a band to benefit from division of labor— and thus to form a whole greater than the sum of its parts— we can expect them to be *four* times better. Which checks out: Among interdependent bands, the greatest *ever* is the Beatles, who are *at least* four times better than whomever the indie camp has to offer!

So now, what potential partner *wouldn't* prefer a BYCombo band such as yours, if you can promise to be *four* times better? In the long run, then, our victory is *assured*! Or to borrow an old [Soviet joke](http://archive.today/2025.03.07/https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/22/world/in-hope-and-dismay-lenin-s-heirs-speak.html#:~:text=In%20the%20Communist,capitalism%20to%20capitalism.''): "Indie rock is the longest and most painful route from interdependence… to interdependence."
