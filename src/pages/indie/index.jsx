By the 90s, the major labels no longer invested in their bands. They simply counted on a few superstars to break out, like Nirvana or Radiohead, and then wrote off the rest as failed bets. By contrast, the indie labels kept with fair practices that promised *all* their artists a working future. A decade later, the majors imploded— so indie rock won! Except now…

Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com) here! I've spent half my life arguing that indie rock has made music *worse*, to no avail. But in recent years, something amazing has happened: Young people have grown disillusioned, and some now agree with me. It turns out they'd *love* a Nirvana and Radiohead of their own. So the interdependence revolution can finally begin!

There's just one problem. Rebelling against centralized institutions is simple: Break all that we hate! But to rebel against a *de*-centralized system like indie rock, we must *build*— which is vastly more difficult. After all, build… what, exactly? Luckily, I've also spent half my life coming up with a plan:

**BYCombo will assemble interdependent bands who'll sacrifice serious chunks of lifetime to make historically consequential demos, which we'll then show in a public registry to sustain an alternative counterculture.**

### The revolution will not be decentralized

Okay, that's a mouthful! Let's break it down…

**Why an alternative counterculture?**

A counterculture is needed to protect dangerous ideas, yet we haven't had one for some time. Meanwhile, despite indie rock's good intentions, music is now worse. But what if music is worse… *because* of these good intentions? What if all this charitable support for *artists*… is actually bad for the *arts*? It's a dangerous idea, yet it might be rock's only hope— so let's protect it.

**Why historical consequence?**

Critical acclaim can be inflated, which makes it a terrible barometer. What *can't* be hacked is the [historical canon](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446), because making history means competing on equal terms with past artists who *didn't* rely on charitable support. In this light, it's likely that *no* indie artist today will be inducted into the canon— and *this* is why people gripe that rock is getting worse.

**Why assembled bands?**

Has rock explored all the ways a band can come together? It might seem so— assuming they'll always form on their own, in a decentralized free-for-all. But if we ditch this notion? Then rock has barely scratched the surface.

What if musicians hoping to form history-making bands could flock to a single hub from across the globe? What if a cartoonist could also join— and bands, in turn, could think to look for one? Or suppose the next Kurt Cobain is a minority woman who's currently struggling to attract bandmates. What if she could ask to be judged free of unconscious bias?

With so many ways left to innovate in this space, there most certainly *are* canonical bands still to come. All that's needed is a centralized initiative like BYCombo to help them come together.

**Why interdependence?**

To make consequential art, a band must develop exceptional strengths. But this isn't humanly possible unless they're allowed to stay weak in areas of administration like marketing and distribution, where a *partner* can be more efficient. That is to say, history-making bands need to be *inter*-dependent, not *indie*-pendent. They *need* a label, or some other business partner.

**Why demos?**

A demo shows what a work can be in the *future*, with a partner's help. This doesn't just free a band to take creative risks; it awakens the very thought to do so— with [doublespeaker rhyme](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/4-odin/?annotation=7) being my own go-to example. Yes, artists today can self-release their works— but this is a *curse*, not a *blessing*. Past artists put out *demos*, and to compete with them means doing likewise.

**Why a public registry?**

It takes time to review an ambitious demo— but the indie labels won't put in this effort, since *any* artist they sign will be charitably supported just the same. So an interdependent band's best bet is to join a counterculture that *criticizes* indie rock's good intentions— and a public registry is where future business partners will know to find them.

**Why serious chunks of lifetime?**

Low barriers to entry have allowed an endless stream of underwhelming artists to pour through, leading people to grow wary and lose interest. But indie rock has no way to reverse this damage, given its decentralized nature.

To save rock, then, a centralized initiative like BYCombo must now step up to enforce a steep *cost* of entry. This cost can't be arbitrary or artificial, so it can only be one thing: a serious chunk of lifetime. After all, a lifetime is all you have; once that chunk is gone, it's *gone*! Which means there's nothing more precious that a band can sacrifice to restore the public's faith.

**And finally… how has indie rock made music worse?**

Here's an incomplete list of ways…

### Cultures of grievance wallow in confusion

In the 90s, "indie" referred to bands like Pavement, who *never* signed to a major label. As Gen X knows, then, Nirvana and Radiohead were *alternative*, not indie. To the younger generations, however, they *sound* indie— so now they are. But… this isn't a trivial mix-up! It's causing us to look for the *next* Nirvana and Radiohead in the wrong places. How did we get confused?

Simply put, indie rock doesn't know what it stands *for*, only whom it stands *against*: the major labels and their middlemen. Like [MAGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again), it's a culture of grievance— and so it shares the same tolerance for confusion. After all, who cares if those on your side are confused in their beliefs, when this is what fires them up to attack your common enemy?

For example, even after [Goatse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goatse.cx) proved that the Internet caters to the lowest common denominator… indie rock concluded that artists who [go viral](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1811-clap-your-hands-say-yeah) *aren't* the new one-hit wonders?! And when Amanda Palmer crowdfunded her way to a million dollars after [leaving Roadrunner](https://pitchfork.com/news/34979-amanda-palmer-tells-roadrunner-records-please-drop-me)… this was taken as proof that artists *don't* benefit from a major label deal?!

In every early example of online success, chance or privilege clearly played a role. Yet indie rock was so eager to "own" the major labels, it downplayed this point. Well, it worked— the Internet came to be seen as the great equalizer. Except now, if an indie artist struggles to succeed online… the public can only assume their music is no good!

As with MAGA, then, indie rock's tolerance for confusion ends up hurting its own. So yes, the major labels did many things wrong— but they got Nirvana and Radiohead *right*! How? With BYCombo, you can now join a movement that's willing to ask— because it holds no grievances.

### Charitable support is a supreme advantage

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review one more time.
`}

As a child, I didn't *support* my favorite bands; I simply *liked* them. Yet today, we say we "support" the artists we like— even the ones who are superstars! How did this happen? It began when indie rock conflated personal fandom with high-minded support for the arts. Naturally, this deprived the arts of greater funding… and the negative effects didn't stop there.

Unlike an arts organization, fans don't need to have rigorous standards or be mindful of unconscious bias; rooting for an underdog— *any* underdog— is noble on its own. But if a fan's charitable support *isn't* open to challengers, then it's *not* just a leg up; it's a supreme advantage! So indie rock started an arms race, where even superstars now angle to be seen as underdogs.

Meanwhile, outsiders who don't enjoy *anyone's* support must compensate by working much harder, to be much better. Yet they'll *still* meet resistance— since the whole point of charitable support is to give the underdog a safe lead. But… this sounds familiar, doesn't it? It's like the historic notion that Blacks have to be [twice as good](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9648466-you-ve-got-to-be-twice-as-good-to-get-half)— only to get half as far!

Clearly, this can't end well. Future generations won't "support" any of today's artists the way ours did; if anything, they'll try to *fix* the damage we caused— much like we topple Confederate statues today. So why be a charity case *and* a wrongdoer? With BYCombo, you can make history the *right* way.

### Timeless works have intrinsic appeal

To get radio airplay in the 90s, alternative bands had to win over listeners who knew nothing about them— and the best did this by composing chords and melodies that [hook you in](https://youtu.be/7bK5EPjGri4) with no further context. Being an unpopular teen at the time, I knew my only hope was to reach their level. So I studied any band whose talents I envied, dreaming that one day I'd teach others.

A while back, I sent copies of my songwriting book [*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com) to all the indie labels; I later did the same with my musical tile game [*Bobtail Dominoes*](https://www.bobtaildominoes.com). But the labels weren't interested… and in time I figured out why: Indie rock has no conception of music as a *craft*.

Because the indie labels always lost those radio-friendly bands to the majors, they learned to reach listeners by first winning over *critics*— and the best did this by putting out works rich in *non*-musical context, often centered on the artist's identity. So today, an acclaimed indie artist is one whom many critics praise— but few musicians study.

Yet no one cares what [past critics thought](https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/why-did-the-beatles-get-so-many-bad), while the past works we love most [*don't* require us](https://youtu.be/UihGpf7lCM8) to know about the artist— and future generations will judge the works of *our* times likewise. There's no way around it: To be timeless, your music must hook in the listener on its *own*. So BYCombo gives you all the time you need to study the craft.

### The opportunity cost is too damn high

In the past, we of the English-speaking world rightfully claimed ours to be *the* rock canon. Our bands had no foreign peers; any who *could* match us, like ABBA, simply joined us instead. But today's indie rock feels like just another foreign canon, because indie artists *never* go above and beyond. Why don't they? Well, let's examine their options.

They can build a fanbase on their own— which yields compound returns, as each fan brings in new fans. What a deal! Moreover, with no talent scouts out there trying to discover artists, it's a huge disadvantage *not* to. *Or*— they can go above and beyond, which yields *marginal* returns for *massive* effort. Yet, by definition, it *isn't* a disadvantage simply not to!

In a world of charitable support, then, the smart choice is obvious. But… what if a band goes above and beyond anyway, hoping to remain peerless? Add up their gains, subtract the [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost), and the math is clear: They'll end up the biggest loser. No wonder we lost the historical canon! Thankfully, with BYCombo, you can now go above and beyond to win it back.

### Serendipity rewards the idle mind

Indie rock requires artists to wear several hats: the marketer hat, the publicist hat… Of course, the best among them don't skimp on wearing the artist hat; they want their art to stay on par with their talents. Yet the best works are even *better* than the artists who make them. Why? Because they *also* benefit from insightful revelations that can't be summoned at will.

These insights emerge from the unconscious mind as your thoughts drift in the shower, or when you daydream out of boredom. But this can't happen if you're always context switching— or worse, multitasking! So keep your artist hat on, and have a partner wear the others. *You* want your art to be better than you, and so does BYCombo.

### Creativity gets its chance from the clueless

Because the indie gatekeepers stay close to their local scenes, they're both "in the know" and "one of us." So whatever *they* like is what others like *us* have liked, which means it's the best of what *we'll* like… right? Yet according to science, it's human nature to [*dis*-like creativity](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/16/science/creativity-implicit-bias.html)!

Creative ideas are unfamiliar, and this makes us uncomfortable. Now, the corporate suits just ignore this discomfort, since it's *all* unfamiliar to them. But those in the know pride themselves on their hard-won instincts, so they interpret the discomfort as a sincere warning from their gut. Ironically, then, as [Frank Zappa noted](https://youtu.be/xP4wsURn3rw), this makes them *worse* at discovering creativity!

Which is why, throughout history, the most creative artists were backed by those with the *least* experience in the arts. Let's face it: The best partners take pride in knowing how to do business, *not* in recognizing great art. Now with BYCombo, you can once again find such partners to back you.

### Modest standing leads to risk aversion

In his book [*Originals*](https://adamgrant.net/book/originals), Adam Grant points out that in any hierarchy, the ones eager to take risks are those securely perched at the top, as well as those at the bottom with nothing to lose. The ones in the middle, by contrast, are the most risk-*averse*. Which explains why indie rock is so unoriginal: Its artists *seek* greater standing while its labels *cede* it— so *no* one takes any risks!

In the past, artists lacked all means to engage with the public in their early years— leaving them free to explore and experiment on their own. But today, indie artists are empowered to build a fanbase from day one— making them unlikely to wander from their earliest artistic decisions.

Meanwhile, because the indie labels have just enough standing to lose, they only make safe bets— and the *safest* bet is to deliver what the people already want. But… this just creates an [echo chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media))! Even worse, it means every revolution gets nipped in the bud, because the [people *never* ask](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/988332) for what they can't envision on their own.

Revolutions may *start* with artists, but they're *spread* by business partners, whose vision is needed to win over the public. This is why BYCombo tells you to explore and experiment, while you have no fans to lose— and then helps you find partners perched high enough to see you as the *smartest* bet.

### The grassroots is now a lottery

We all respect those [80s indie bands](https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/michael-azerrad/our-band-could-be-your-life/9780316247184) who started from the grassroots, don't we? After all, they were chosen by the people, *not* by the elite. Yet there's a less spoken reason as well: Their success feels *earned* to us. That is to say, they put in the work each day for untold years— unlike a one-hit wonder, who simply lucked out and won the virtual lottery.

In those days, lottery players would sign lopsided deals with a label, all for a single chance at exposure. But the Internet has since empowered them to reach the people directly, giving them unlimited chances— while making them indie artists in good faith! So now they're drowning us all in their music— *and* getting respect for it.

Of course, for those who only see the grassroots as a [*populist*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism) domain… this is as it should be! After all, getting likes on social media *is* the modern version of drawing a live crowd, and machine learning algorithms *are* the new word of mouth. Which means today's indie artists are *still* chosen by the people, not by the elite— as it's always been.

It's just no longer the case that equally worthy artists will see comparable results, because the grassroots has ceased to be a [*meritocratic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy) domain. But what if you were hoping to *earn* your success? Well, you can join BYCombo, and put in the work each day for untold years— on your craft!

### Talent wants a path to stardom

By the 00s, the major labels had gutted the local scenes in their search for the next superstars. So when the Internet promised us a vibrant [long tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail) decoupled from the rat race for stardom, indie rock went all in: Any artist could now flourish on the fringes! Yet today… superstars are bigger than ever, while indie artists have lost even *artistic* relevance. Why is this?

It's because stardom *isn't* caused by corporate greed, but by our own social nature. We *don't* need to hear the best; we just want to like what others like— and they feel the same! As a result, popularity is a [complex system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system) ruled by [power laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law), where random boosts can snowball into supreme advantages— and *this* is how unworthy artists end up as superstars.

But stardom is also the rightful outcome for the *most* worthy artists, who naturally hope for it— even if, like Kurt Cobain, they won't admit it. So indie rock got it backward: The major labels *didn't* exploit the indie labels. It was precisely *because* the indies were seen as farm teams for the majors that those 90s alternative bands signed with them in the first place.

By shutting off this pipeline to the majors, then, indie rock *didn't* help the most worthy artists flourish; it caused them to *flee*! So BYCombo is here to restore the path to rock stardom. Because if superstars are inevitable, then why can't *you*— who aspires to be *most* worthy— get a chance to be one?

`}

### History is made through peer review

Here's the thing: Most artists in the historical canon were superstars in their own day. But indie rock's bet is on the long tail— so how is *any* indie artist expected to make history? The critics have a plan: Pick one who typifies the underdog of our times, then rally around them. After all, who wouldn't root for an underdog to win?

Um… all of us other artists who *weren't* picked, that's who! To be clear, we're not [crabs in a bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality). But if a critical darling strikes us as a lottery winner, we won't pretend otherwise. And this gets at why critics are so bad at making timeless judgments: They never consider how things look to us *other* artists.

Because we're invested in the creative process ourselves, we commit fewer false positives: We know when talents deemed notable are actually par for the course. And we commit fewer false *negatives*: We'll give crazy new ideas a chance, knowing the courage it takes to put them into action. In short, what historians will see in *time*… other artists come closest to seeing *today*.

So to make history without achieving stardom, ignore the critics! Instead, your talents must inspire the envy of fellow *artists*. Which is why BYCombo includes you in a community of peers who'll keep your standards high.

### Commodified signals are worthless

Every now and then, I'll get over my dislike of social media to see what the indie gatekeepers are saying among themselves. So when Elon Musk added [verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_verification) to his Twitter Blue service plan, I saw them argue that this would make the blue checkmark worthless— which amused me. After all… indie rock is the Twitter Blue of music!

Musk wanted *everyone* to have access to a discerning audience, not just the elite— and so he made it available for a small fee. Hey… you know who *else* thought this way? The indie gatekeepers in the 00s! They wanted *every* artist to reach the public directly using the online tools they provided.

But clearly, they see the problem here— at least when it comes to Twitter. If greater access to an audience can be bought— with money, or with time and energy— then it's no longer an [honest signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signaling_game), is it? The discerning "receiver" learns not to trust it, the worthy "sender" learns not to value it— and then both yearn to leave for places where honest signaling still happens.

Well, BYCombo promises to be such a place! Because what can be a more honest signal than sacrificing a serious chunk of lifetime?

### Competitive self-reliance favors privilege

To promote self-reliance, indie rock requires artists to do the middleman's job for themselves. But a wealthy artist can just pay *others* to do it… and, well, who better to hire than a former middleman?! So in the end, indie rock has done little more than "privatize" access to business deals that were once "public"— to the benefit of the privileged. How did this happen?

To understand the problem, let's first observe that indie rock enjoys the goodwill generated by artistic movements of *cooperative* self-reliance, such as the [Maker Faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_Faire), that are united by love of the *craft*. Now, this *would* be fitting— if indie artists simply made music for their *own* fulfillment.

Instead, each one tries to command the *public's* attention— and at any given time, attention paid to one *isn't* paid to the rest. Which means indie rock is really about *competitive* self-reliance! Its artists live for the *hustle*— just like [libertarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism) in politics— and nothing makes hustling easier than privilege.

The problem, then, is that indie rock's artistic libertarianism is a *partisan* ideal that gets mistaken as *universal*. So when a band struggles to hustle because it's a poor fit for their circumstances, they're told to just suck it up and try harder. Now with BYCombo, there's an opposition party that upholds the interdependence you want— out of respect for your craft.

### Hungry outsiders aim for the canon

Who foresaw indie rock's final stage as a trust fund playground? We did— women and minorities— which is why *we've* never started a movement to compete on self-reliance. And hip hop is no exception; rappers *proudly* rely on [labels and producers](https://genius.com/10900). When they boast of having hustled, they're saying, "Hey, I hustled *too*!" It's to ensure that self-reliance means *nothing*.

Yet despite the poor fit, indie rock sure is eager of late to hand over its reins to us. Why? Because it's in *decline*! After two decades with little to show that could matter to history, indie rock now feels like just another foreign canon. So women and minorities are being nudged onto a [glass cliff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_cliff)…

No thanks! Remember, rock and roll was founded by poor Blacks and queers, then taken further by rural Southerners, Midwestern Jews, working-class Brits… In short, it's a history of hungry outsiders. Which means women and minorities should naturally be aiming for the *historical* canon— and today we *would* be, if indie rock hadn't intervened.

Like those outsiders before us, we need to be the *most* original, the *most* talented… but this can only happen if we're allowed to rely on business partners. Hip hop gets this, which is why it *hasn't* declined; Kendrick Lamar won a [Pulitzer Prize](https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/kendrick-lamar)! Now BYCombo gives you the same chances— as a band.

### Interdependence guards against prejudice

Indie rock is an ideology more than anything else— and ideologies transcend time. So why couldn't rock be indie from the *beginning*? Imagine, then, that we take a time machine back to the 50s and announce: "Artists, your success now rests solely upon building a fanbase on your own. A business partner can no longer help you!"

Every Black artist would stare glumly at us. Why? Because back then, they *needed* White partners to advocate on their behalf. Indie rock's rules would work like an artistic [poll tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poll_taxes_in_the_United_States), shutting them out in *effect*— without admitting to this *intent*. By bringing indie rock to the 50s, then… we'd look like White supremacists. But this *wasn't* our intent! So where did we go wrong?

It's simple: Given its decentralized nature, indie rock can't guard against the prejudices of its times. It can only *reflect* them— and the 50s were openly racist! Well, is society free of prejudice today? Of course not— which is why BYCombo lets you find partners to advocate on your behalf. Because if *you* see interdependence as the great equalizer… who is anyone else to argue?

### Independence breeds homogeneity

Every indie gatekeeper who's met with me has drawn the same conclusion: Yes, my [projects are impressive](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/23566)— but I'm a hobbyist. Why do they misjudge me so badly? I used to wonder. Then it hit me: I *haven't* been rejected by a hundred gatekeepers. I've been rejected by the same one, a hundred times over— who then looks for the same artist, a hundred times over!

To be interdependent, you need partners who are strong where you're weak, and vice versa— which means you value others who are as lopsided as you, but in opposite ways. Those who want independence, however, can have no real weaknesses, and thus no real strengths. They need to be well-rounded— and this leads them to converge on a single way of thinking.

So don't be fooled by indie rock's belated embrace of women and minorities: There's still no diversity of *thought*— and there never will be. But BYCombo lets you find partners who think differently… and who'll value *you* for doing the same.

### The underdog is an eternal villain

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review a few times. Fourth paragraph, be more inclusive about who's most likely to make history. Third paragraph, point out that true disadvantage is having no one wanting to root for you as the underdog.

Third paragraph. Don't need to mention charitable support again. Mention supreme advantage instead. Make reference to KKK overt. Point out it was America's original underdog movement meant to subjugate the outsider.

Fourth paragraph. Irrelevance is too soft. Change it in home page as well.

Future generations will be clear-eyed about which artists we *wanted* to root for— their privilege will be salient to future generations in a way that it simply isn't to ours.
`}

Perhaps you think these arguments against indie rock are moot. After all, didn't [poptimism defeat rockism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockism_and_poptimism) a decade ago? Well, no. It was the *indie* camp who killed rock as a genre. Then, believing the death to be natural, many in this camp switched to pop— and took their indie sensibilities with them. So poptimism… is really the new indie rock!

Ignore the superficial differences in sound: Indie rock and poptimism are both underdog movements that supplanted a previous culture founded by outsiders. While the former defeated the revolutionary spirit of classic rock that traced its lineage to Sister Rosetta Tharpe, the latter defeated the classic pop defined by Tin Pan Alley's immigrants and taken further by Motown.

Like indie rock, poptimism exists to charitably support the underdog. But this means it has the same fatal flaw: Since charitable support is an *advantage*, any artist who receives it *won't* be treated as an underdog by future generations. Which shouldn't surprise us— after all, no one in history whom *we* remember today was an underdog in *their* own time!

So all underdog movements are destined to fade into irrelevance. And yet… because they benefit the privileged, they'll always live on in some form. Luckily, BYCombo is here to ensure that outsiders— the ones most likely to make history!— will continue to have a fighting chance against them.

### Paid dues must now collude

For many years, I worked days as a coder and nights on my audio webcomic. When I came back to the music world, I was surprised to hear indie artists speak of paying their dues— to justify, let's say, touring at a loss. In the tech world, "paid dues" is a synonym for "fake work"— and outsiders who see this, disrupt industries that don't. But why *don't* the disrupted ever see this?

It's because paid dues are worthless outside the one system that honors them— so by nature, any such system breeds loyalty to its rule. In short, you can pay your dues, or you can start a revolution… but never both.

Moreover, once someone has wasted their best years building up symbolic credentials rather than enviable talents, they can never feel secure enough to let others surpass them. As a result, the only newcomers they'll accept are those willing to squander even *more* potential. But these newcomers will then feel even *less* secure— thus perpetuating a [vicious circle](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/391717).

Which is why it took an outsider like myself to start BYCombo, driven by an urge to help future bands surpass me. My solution is so simple, I doubt I'm the first artist to think of it. Rather, I'm just the first one who's secure enough to *want* it— having never paid indie rock's dues myself.

### Happiness flows from the act of creation

At the peak of my years working eighty-hour weeks— forty to earn a living, and forty on my own projects— a friend staged an intervention. On a scale of one to ten, he asked, how happy am I? Eight, I replied. He was dumbfounded; he'd expected a three. And so I cleared up the matter: The very reason I chose this path was to *guarantee* my happiness.

In his book [*Flow*](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/flow-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi), Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi explains that when an artist has a clear goal; feels adequately challenged; and gets feedback to guide their progress, they become fully immersed in the act of creation— leading to long-term fulfillment. This is why my years of sacrifice were some of my happiest; I *wasn't* slowly killing myself, as my friend had feared.

Meanwhile, there's a [mental health crisis](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/music-and-mental-health) in music today, with artists facing high levels of anxiety and depression. Why is this? It's because indie rock can never admit the truth: Anything earned through self-reliance might just as well be won by chance or bought by privilege. Every indie artist knows this, yet they play the losing game anyway… and it eats at their soul.

So yes, BYCombo requires you to focus on your craft. But this isn't *just* to make your art better! It's also for your happiness— and the good of your soul.

### Longevity is the last frontier

The best composers got *better* with age— Beethoven, for one, composed his [magnum opus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._9_(Beethoven)) in the final years of his life. But this isn't yet the case with rock bands— which means there's a whole frontier left to explore! Unfortunately… indie rock isn't up for this task: Hustling requires a youthful spirit, so every indie artist eventually burns out.

By contrast, a deep love of the craft can motivate you for a lifetime. After all, to take on greater challenges, you must build your talents further— and to build your talents further, you must take on greater challenges… onward and upward, in a virtuous circle. So BYCombo keeps you in it for the long haul, by helping you stay in love with your craft.

### Art needs the passion of martyrs

"Where's *our* Nirvana?" It's a question asked by today's young people. Well, there's an easy way to answer it: Can we imagine the *next* generation asking of any band today, "Where's *our* _____?" If so, then _____ is this generation's Nirvana. Of course, we can't— because this generation never got its Nirvana. Why is this?

It's because we really only pine for past artists who self-sacrificed to advance the art form. But indie rock is here to *save* artists from exploitation, and so it roots for those who *empower* themselves instead. As such, indie artists today demand fair compensation; they don't self-sacrifice for *anyone*— because to do so is a classic sign of being exploited.

What's so bad about self-empowerment, though? Well, for one, it's really just self-serving, power-seeking behavior in those we see as underdogs; it's not noble in and of itself. For another, in a decentralized system, artists with this trait hold the *advantage*— so how are *they* the underdogs?

Worst of all, self-empowered artists will never *start* a revolution, because the means to fair compensation only get settled at the *end*. To save rock, then, we *need* to make way for bands who'll self-sacrifice to advance the art form. In other words, after the Age of Empowerment… comes the Age of Martyrdom.

Let's never go back to the days of artists dying young, of course. Thankfully, history tells of another kind of martyr: those who sacrificed not their *lives*, but their *lifetimes*. Can we imagine this generation's Nirvana being an entire *movement* of selfless bands, each one sacrificing a serious chunk of lifetime? If so, then BYCombo is here to give us the next Nirvana *now*!
