# ${TITLE}

By the '90s, the major labels no longer nurtured their bands; they'd simply sign hundreds of no-names to unfair contracts, hoping for a superstar or two to break out. But the indie labels held to fair practices by only signing artists empowered enough *not* to need a label in the first place. A decade later, the majors imploded— so indie rock won! Except now…

Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com) here! I've spent half my life arguing that indie rock has made music *worse*, to no avail. But in recent years, something amazing has happened: Young people have grown disillusioned, and some now agree with me. It turns out they'd *love* a Nirvana and Radiohead of their own. So the interdependence revolution can finally begin!

There's just one problem. Rebelling against centralized institutions is simple: Break all that we hate! But to rebel against a *de*-centralized system like indie rock, we must *build*— which is vastly more difficult. After all, build… what, exactly? Luckily, I've also spent half my life coming up with a plan:

**BYCombo's assembled bands will sacrifice serious chunks of lifetime to make historically canonical demos, which they'll show in a public registry to find business partners from a counterculture of interdependence.**

### The revolution will *not* be decentralized

Okay, that's a mouthful! Let's break it down…

**Why a counterculture?**

A counterculture protects dangerous ideas, yet we haven't had one for some time. Meanwhile, despite indie rock's good intentions, music is now worse. But what if music is worse… *because* of these good intentions? What if all this charitable support for *artists*… is actually bad for the *arts*? It's a dangerous idea, yet it might be rock's only hope— so let's protect it.

**Why the historical canon?**

When fans charitably support an artist, they want *content*— namely, art that engages with them directly. But while content has an advantage over *past* art, it loses once it's in the past *itself*. To belong in the [historical canon](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446), then, today's artists must consciously *aim* to do so— because without this intent, they'll naturally settle for being content creators instead.

**Why bands?**

Indie rock encourages artists to retain their earnings— which, today, means having fewer bandmates, if any. But what competitive edge could a solo artist possibly have these days, to put them among the best for all *time*? From now until forever, if artists want to aim for the canon, they'll need to be greater than the sum of their parts— and in rock, this happens by forming *bands*.

**Why *assembled* bands?**

Has rock explored all the ways a band can come together? It might seem so— assuming they'll always form on their own, in a decentralized free-for-all. But if we ditch this notion? Then rock has barely scratched the surface.

What if artists hoping to form history-making bands could flock to a single hub from across the world? What if a cartoonist could also join— and bands, in turn, could think to look for one? Or suppose the next Kurt Cobain is a minority woman who's struggling to attract bandmates. What if she could ask to be judged free of unconscious bias?

With so many ways left to innovate in this space, there most certainly *are* canonical bands still to come. All that's needed is a centralized initiative like BYCombo to help them come together.

**Why interdependent partnerships?**

To aim for the canon, a band must develop exceptional strengths. But this isn't humanly possible unless they're allowed to stay weak in matters of business like marketing and distribution, where a *partner* can be more efficient. That is to say, history-making bands need to be *inter*-dependent, not *indie*-pendent; they need to *need* a business partner.

**Why demos?**

A demo shows what a work can be in the *future*, with a partner's help. This doesn't just free a band to take creative risks; it awakens the very thought to do so— with [doublespeaker rhyme](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/4-odin/?annotation=7) being my own go-to example. Yes, anyone today can self-release their works— but this is a *curse*, not a *blessing*. Past artists put out *demos*, and to compete with them means doing likewise.

**Why a public registry?**

It takes time to review an ambitious demo— but the indie labels won't put in this effort, since *any* artist they sign will be charitably supported just the same. So an interdependent band's best bet is to partner with those who recognize the *folly* of indie rock's good intentions— and a public registry is where they'll find each other.

**Why serious chunks of lifetime?**

Low barriers to entry have allowed an endless stream of underwhelming artists to pour through, leading people to grow wary and lose interest. But indie rock has no way to reverse this damage, given its decentralized nature. To save rock, then, a centralized initiative like BYCombo must now step up to enforce a steep *cost* of entry.

This cost can't be arbitrary or artificial, so it can only be one thing: a serious chunk of lifetime. After all, a lifetime is all you truly have; once that chunk is gone, it's *gone*! Which means there's nothing more precious for a band to sacrifice that can earn the trust of business partners, discerning listeners, and future historians alike.

**And finally… how has indie rock made music worse?**

Here's an incomplete list of ways…

### ${++sectionCounter}. Nursed grievances wallow in confusion

In the '90s, "indie" referred to bands like Pavement, who *never* signed to a major label. As Gen X knows, then, Nirvana and Radiohead were *alternative*, not indie. To the younger generations, however, they *sound* indie— so now they are. But… this isn't a trivial mix-up! It's causing us to look for the *next* Nirvana and Radiohead in the wrong places. How did we get confused?

Simply put, indie rock doesn't know what it stands *for*, only whom it stands *against*: the major labels and their middlemen. Like MAGA, it's a culture of anti-elitist grievance— and so it shares the same tolerance for confusion. After all, who cares if those on your side are confused in their beliefs, when this is what fires them up to attack your common enemy?

For example, even after Goatse proved that the Internet caters to the lowest common denominator… indie rock concluded that bands who go viral *aren't* just the new one-hit wonders?! And when Amanda Palmer crowdfunded her way to a million dollars… this was taken as proof that artists *don't* benefit from a [major label deal](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/26/amanda-palmer-future-of-music#:~:text=You%20could%20argue,kind%20of%20exposure%3F)?!

In every early example of online success, chance or privilege clearly played a role. Yet the indie pundits were so eager to "own" the major labels, they downplayed this point. Well, it worked— the Internet came to be seen as the great equalizer. Except now, if an indie artist struggles to succeed online… the public just assumes their music is no good!

As with MAGA, then, indie rock's tolerance for confusion ends up hurting its own. So yes, the major labels did many things wrong— but they got Nirvana and Radiohead *right*! How? With BYCombo, you can now join a movement that's willing to ask— because it nurses no grievances.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Cultural chauvinism can only be justified

Growing up as a second-generation immigrant, I knew early on that other countries had their [own rock canons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_kei). Yet because they clearly looked up to ours— the English-speaking world's— we cared little of theirs. Which made ours *the* rock canon! Especially since any band of theirs who *could* rival us, like ABBA… simply joined us instead.

So I've long understood that, to belong in the canon next to the Beatles,  my band needs to be one of the best in the *world*. But the indie camp scorns my way of thinking, saying it reeks of cultural chauvinism: "Who are we to think we're better than other countries? Let a thousand canons bloom, with ours being just one of them!"

Yet… this indie camp will then complain that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame doesn't give [recent artists](https://uproxx.com/indie/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-bias-against-alt-indie-rock) a fair chance to get in. But unlike past inductees, today's indie artists *aren't* better than their foreign counterparts— who have *no* chance! So they're *not* helping to justify calling ours *the* rock canon… in which case, why would they belong in *the* Rock Hall?

Let's be honest, we're cultural chauvinists either way; all we can do is not be hypocrites as well. Thankfully, BYCombo is here to make us the world's best once more, in the only way now possible— by matching you with artists from other countries, who *could* rival you… but will join your band instead.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Charitable support starts an arms race

In the past, the only artists we said we "supported" were amateurs, recluses, the mentally ill… Yet today's fans use the term to show loyalty to *any* artist— even a superstar! How did this happen? It began when indie rock conflated personal taste with high-minded endowment for the arts, making every fan a philanthropist— a "phlan," maybe?

Unlike an arts foundation, though, phlans *don't* need to hold strict standards or be aware of unconscious bias. Their charitable support for the underdog— *any* underdog— comes from good intentions and thus can't be questioned. But then… this *isn't* just a leg up, is it? It's a supreme advantage! And unlike amateurs or the mentally ill, indie artists *do* vie for all the same honors.

So indie rock set off a chain reaction, forcing the next tier of artists to beg for support as well, and then the next… leading to where we are today, with even superstars angling to be seen as underdogs. Which explains why Millennials never gave us a Shaggs or Daniel Johnston of [their own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_music): All their charitable impulses went toward defending the *least* helpless!

And yet, this obviously can't end well. We don't "support" artists of the past— and neither will future audiences. So why stoop to being a charity case today, just to be swept onto an ash heap tomorrow? With BYCombo, you can make history the *right* way— by needing no defense to begin with.

### ${++sectionCounter}. The grassroots is now a lottery

We all respect those ['80s indie bands](https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/michael-azerrad/our-band-could-be-your-life/9780316247184) who came up from the local scenes, don't we? After all, they were chosen by the people, *not* by the elite. Yet there's a less spoken reason as well: It feels like their success was *ensured*. That is to say, they showed up to work each day for untold years— unlike a one-hit wonder, who simply lucked out and won the virtual lottery.

In those days, lottery players would sign lopsided deals with a major label, all for a single chance at exposure. But the Internet has since empowered them to reach the public directly, giving them unlimited chances— while making them indie artists in good faith! So now they're flooding the world with their music— *and* getting respect for it.

Yet according to the indie labels and pundits… this is as it should be! Because ultimately, their main concern is for artists to be chosen by the people, *not* by the elite— and what are recommendation algorithms, if not the new word of mouth? The grassroots, in essence, is still very much a *populist* domain.

It's just that now, little but chance separates the few who make it from the many who don't, because the grassroots is no longer a *meritocratic* domain. But… what if *you* were hoping to ensure your success? Then keep working on your craft for untold years— and let BYCombo expose you to a new elite!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Talent wants a path to stardom

By the '00s, the major labels had gutted the local scenes in their search for the next superstars. So when the Internet promised us a vibrant [long tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail) decoupled from the rat race for stardom, indie rock went all in: Any artist could now flourish on the fringes! Yet today… superstars are bigger than ever, while indie artists have *lost* cultural relevance. Why is this?

It's because stardom *isn't* caused by corporate greed, but by our own social nature. We *don't* need to hear the best; we just want to like what others like— and they feel the same! As a result, popularity is a [complex system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system) ruled by [power laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law), where random boosts can snowball into winning advantages— and *this* is how unworthy artists end up as superstars.

But stardom is also the rightful outcome for the *most* worthy artists, who naturally hope for it— even if, like Kurt Cobain, they won't admit it. So the indie camp got it backward: The majors *didn't* exploit the local scenes. They simply saw the indie labels as farm teams— as did those alternative bands in the '90s, who signed with the indies for this very reason!

By blocking all access to the majors, then, indie rock *didn't* help the most worthy artists flourish; it caused them to *flee*! So BYCombo is here to build a new path to rock stardom. Because if superstars are inevitable, then why can't *you*— who aspires to be most worthy— get *your* chance to be one?

### ${++sectionCounter}. History is made through peer review

Here's the thing: Most artists in the historical canon were superstars in their own day. But indie rock's bet is on the long tail— so how is *any* indie artist expected to make history? The critics have a plan: Pick one who typifies the underdog of our times, then rally around them. After all, who wouldn't root for an underdog to win?

Um… all of us other artists who *weren't* picked, that's who! To be clear, we're not [crabs in a bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality). But if a critical darling strikes us as a lottery winner, we won't pretend otherwise. And this gets at why [critics are so bad](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/why-did-the-beatles-get-so-many-bad) at making timeless judgments: They never consider how things look to us *other* artists.

Because we're invested in the creative process ourselves, we commit fewer false positives: We know when talents deemed notable are actually par for the course. And we commit fewer false *negatives*: We'll give crazy new ideas a chance, knowing the courage it takes to put them into action. In short, what historians will see in *time*… other artists come closest to seeing *today*.

So to make history without achieving stardom, ignore the critics! Instead, your talents must inspire the envy of fellow *artists*. Which is why BYCombo includes you in a community of peers who'll keep your standards high.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Timeless works have standalone appeal

To get radio airplay in the '90s, alternative bands had to win over listeners who knew nothing about them— and the best did this by crafting chords and melodies that [hook you in](https://youtu.be/7bK5EPjGri4) with no further context. Being an unpopular teen at the time, I knew my only hope was to pull off the same. So I studied any band whose talents I envied, dreaming that one day I'd teach others.

A while back, I sent copies of my songwriting book [*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com) to all the indie labels; I later did the same with my musical tile game [*Bobtail Dominoes*](https://www.bobtaildominoes.com). They weren't interested, though… and in time I figured out why: Indie rock has no conception of music as a *craft*.

Because the indie labels always lost those radio-friendly bands to the majors, they learned to bypass radio by appealing to critics and local fans. But critics want context that can be discussed at length, while local fans— or these days, online fans— like to engage directly with the artist. So both, in their own way, are drawn more to an artist's identity than to a well-crafted hook.

Yet the past works we love most [*don't* require us](https://youtu.be/UihGpf7lCM8?t=11) to care about the artist— and future audiences will judge the works of *our* times likewise. There's no way around it: To be timeless, your music must hook in the listener on its *own*. So BYCombo gives you all the time you need to study the craft.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Excellence has a steep opportunity cost

Thanks to indie rock, other countries now care little about our rock canon, just as we've always cared little of theirs— which stands to reason, since indie artists *never* go above and beyond to make the best art. But… why *don't* they? Well, let's examine their options.

They can build a fanbase on their own— which yields *compound* returns, as each fan brings in new fans. Moreover, with no talent scouts out there trying to discover them, it's a huge disadvantage *not* to. *Or*— they can go above and beyond to make the best art, which yields *diminishing* returns for every *increase* in effort. Yet, by definition, it *isn't* a disadvantage simply not to!

The sane choice, then, is obvious. But… what happens if a band tries to make the best art *anyway*? Add up their gains, subtract the [opportunity costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost), and the math is clear: They'll end up the biggest losers. No wonder we lost the historical canon! But with BYCombo, you can now be discovered for going above and beyond to bring it back.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Serendipity rewards the idle mind

Indie artists need to wear several hats: the promoter hat, the publicist hat… Of course, the best among them don't skimp on wearing the artist hat; they want their art to stay on par with their talents. Yet the best works are even *better* than the artists who make them. Why? Because they *also* benefit from creative insights that can't be summoned at will.

These insights emerge from the unconscious mind as your thoughts drift in the shower, or when you daydream out of boredom. But this can't happen if you're always context switching— or worse, multitasking! So keep your artist hat on, and have a business partner wear the others. *You* want your art to be better than you, and so does BYCombo.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Creativity gets its chance from the clueless

In the '90s, the indie gatekeepers stayed close to their local scenes, making them both "in the know" and "one of us." And this holds true today, even as everything has moved online: What they like is what others like us have liked, which means it's what *we'll* like. What's not to like? Yet according to science… it's in our human nature to [*dis*-like creativity](https://slate.com/technology/2013/12/creativity-is-rejected-teachers-and-bosses-dont-value-out-of-the-box-thinking.html#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20all%20a,their%20insistence%20otherwise.)!

Creative ideas are unfamiliar, and this makes us uncomfortable. Now, the corporate suits just ignore the discomfort, since it's *all* unfamiliar to them. But those "in the know" pride themselves on their hard-won instincts, so they interpret the discomfort as a sincere warning from their gut. Ironically, then, as [Frank Zappa noted](https://youtu.be/xP4wsURn3rw), this makes them *worse* at discovering creativity!

Which explains why *Yearling's Bobtail*, my "[*Ulysses* of rock albums](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/7-m/?annotation=42)," remains ignored by the indie camp… In my perpetual insecurity as an outsider, I'd set out to create a work of art whose objective creativity *can't* be disputed— only to find that this is the *last* thing a gatekeeper who's "one of us" should want!

It's no surprise, then, that history's most creative works were often backed by those with the [*least* qualification](https://youtu.be/AClN5X0eEvI) to do so. Let's face it, a good partner takes pride in doing great business, *not* in knowing great art. Now with BYCombo, you can once again find one to back you.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Modest standing leads to risk aversion

In his book [*Originals*](https://adamgrant.net/book/originals), Adam Grant points out that in any hierarchy, the ones eager to take risks are those securely perched at the top, as well as those at the bottom with nothing to lose. The ones in the middle, by contrast, are the most risk-*averse*. Which explains why indie rock is so unoriginal: Its artists *seek* greater standing while its labels *cede* it— so *no* one takes any risks!

In the past, artists lacked all means to engage with the public on their own, freeing them to explore at will. But today, indie artists build a fanbase from the get-go, leaving them reluctant to experiment for fear of losing their fans.

Meanwhile, because the indie labels have just enough standing to lose, they only make safe bets— and the *safest* bet is to deliver what the people already want. But… this creates an echo chamber! Even worse, every revolution gets nipped in the bud, because the [people *never* ask](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/988332) for what they can't envision on their own.

Revolutions may *start* with artists, but they're *spread* by business partners, whose know-how is needed to win over the public. This is why BYCombo lets you explore and experiment, while you have no fans to lose: It makes you the *smartest* bet— for those perched high enough to see it.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Disintermediation is a middleman's dream

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review.
`}

To help artists cut out the middleman, indie rock provides them with tools to do the middleman's job for themselves. Of course, the Bizarro way would be to empower *middlemen* to do the *artist's* job. Absurd, right? Yet the outcome would be exactly the same, with each person now doing the job of both artist *and* middleman. So indie rock… is its own Bizarro world!

And here's more absurdity: Whereas artists are loved for doing what we all dream to do, middlemen are hated for doing work that few would enjoy. In this new hybrid role, then, an artist *has* to be their own middleman— but a middleman *gets* to be their own artist. So a world without middlemen… is a dream of those who would otherwise be *middlemen*, not artists!

Let's be clear, the best artists *respect* the middleman. After all, being the best at your job makes it an awful waste to do anyone else's— and knowing that your own job is much harder than it looks, you have to assume the same of everyone else's. Plus, if you're one of the best yourself, then you get your pick of the best partners. We learned [all this](https://study.com/academy/lesson/division-of-labor-text-lessons-test.html) in middle school!

Sadly, young people never question today's auto-Bizarro world, since it's all they've ever known. But I came of age *before* indie rock took over, and so I've *only* ever dreamt of having one job as an artist— seeing that it's the only way to make the best art! Now with BYCombo, this dream can be yours as well.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Competitive self-reliance favors privilege

Want even more absurdity? A [wealthy artist](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2316349-parent-names-are-blue-on-wikipedia) can just pay *others* to do the middleman's job for them… and, well, who better to hire than a freelance middleman?! So in the end, indie rock has done little more than "privatize" access to business deals that were once "public"— to the benefit of the privileged. How did this happen?

Simply put, indie rock is widely seen as a [do-it-yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself) movement— the kind that fosters *cooperative* self-reliance by instilling love for the craft. As such, it meets with no opposition and enjoys the same goodwill. Now, this *would* be fitting— if indie artists only made music for their *own* fulfillment.

But being indie means gaining the *public's* attention, and this is a zero-sum game: When attention is paid to one artist, it *isn't* being paid to the rest. So the indie camp is really about *competitive* self-reliance! Like libertarians in politics, they want "doing it yourself" to be how you even survive at *all*— and having privilege is the [greatest predictor](https://www.cracked.com/article_40871_penn-jillette-wants-to-talk-it-all-out.html#:~:text=Many%20times%20when,100%20percent%20accurate.) of this belief.

The problem, then, is that indie rock's cultural libertarianism is a *partisan* ideal that gets mistaken as *universal*. So when a band struggles to hustle because it's a poor fit for their circumstances, they're told to suck it up and try harder. But with BYCombo, there's now an opposition party that upholds the interdependence you want— out of respect for your craft.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Mutual reliance creates wealth

In game theory, the [stag hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt) is a game in which you and another player, each on your own, must decide whether to hunt hares separately, or to team up and hunt a stag together. The stag yields far more meat, even when split two ways. But if you trust the other player and go for the stag— only for *them* to doubt *you* and thus stick with hares— you'll end up with nothing.

The [richest nations](https://slate.com/culture/2007/09/the-obscure-game-theory-problem-that-explains-why-rich-countries-are-rich.html#:~:text=the%20difference%20between,and%20poor%20ones.) build systems that allow their citizens to trust each other and confidently "hunt the stag," creating more wealth for all. The converse is also true: North Korea, a poor nation, leaves its citizens to "hunt hares"— and fittingly, its [state ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche) translates to "self-reliance." Well, now you know where this is going: Indie rock… is the North Korea of music!

Indie artists work hard *not* to need a label, and will do so even [when signed](https://pitchfork.com/news/34979-amanda-palmer-tells-roadrunner-records-please-drop-me#:~:text=I've%20built%20up,functioning%20independently%20anyway.) to one— on the label's dime! So labels have learned to doubt artists as well… destroying the mutual reliance needed to create cultural wealth. Yet there's hope: Much like South Korea shows what North Korea can one day become, the past proves that rock can be interdependent once again!

BYCombo just needs artists like you, who *want* to need a label, to join with the Bobtail Yearlings and go for the stag, over and over— despite ending up with nothing, again and again— until business partners finally reciprocate the courage to team up with us. Yes, it's the definition of insanity… but to stick with hares is to live in cultural poverty forever. So how about it?

### ${++sectionCounter}. Democratization drowns signals in noise

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review a few more times.
`}

Once in a while, I'll get over my dislike of social media to see what the indie pundits are saying. So when Elon Musk ["democratized" Twitter](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587498907336118274) by giving the blue checkmark to paid accounts, I saw them argue that he missed the point: "Hey Elon, verification serves the *audience*." Which made me chuckle!

Musk wanted *everyone* to have an audience, not just those verified under "legacy" criteria— so he made the same perks available to *anyone*, for a fee. Hey, you know who *else* thinks this way? The indie pundits! They want *every* artist to be heard, not just those "verified" by a label— so they encourage the use of online tools that cost nothing, other than the grunt work put in.

Yet this misses the point, doesn't it? Once access to an audience is trivial to attain, it ceases to be an [honest signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signaling_game); we can no longer assume that those who have it are worth hearing from. If anything, the strongest signals will now be sent by the *least* worthy— since they alone can fully invest in the signal itself, rather than in the worth being signified!

Still, there's hope: While Millennials were encouraged to be active creators from day one, Gen Z reverted to being passive consumers in the Internet's more stable years. As with Boomers and Gen X, then, Gen Z's artists relate to the *audience* foremost— having been an audience first *themselves*— and so they *don't* feel served by indie rock's "democratization" of music.

Instead, they yearn to receive— and thus send!— honest signals once again. But how? Why, through BYCombo! Because what can be a more honest signal of your worth, than that you sacrificed a serious chunk of lifetime to earn it?

### ${++sectionCounter}. Hustlers lack a theory of future minds

Nick Drake was ignored in his own time— yet the next generation made him known to history. Did they need to see him hustle? No, they simply judged his works. So there's a lesson here for all gatekeepers: To discover artists that future audiences will want to *re*-discover, just… [think like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind) a future audience.

In the past, the major labels did just that: Their talent scouts would sign any artist based on a stellar demo— even one with no fanbase, like Nick Drake. But indie rock taught Millennials to hustle, and hustlers actively work to get themselves known. As a result, the notion is now vulgar that anyone could ever be *made* known, simply by deserving it.

Let's imagine, though, that as a musician devoted to your craft, you *refuse* to hustle. The thought makes you feel awful, like being a [pickup artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_artist) would. Sure, this approach can work… but *should* it? And if women have learned to guard against negging, then why wouldn't fans do the same against artists [milking free labor](https://exiledfan.substack.com/p/the-big-business-of-stan-culture) out of parasocial exchanges?

So instead, you strive to be what a future audience— or romantic partner!— *would* want you to be, based on theories that you revise and refine over time. Which… is also more fun and rewarding for *you*, right? Yet in my experience… the indie gatekeepers can't sympathize. They're loyal to the hustlers— having hustled to get where they are themselves!

But why would Gen Z— and beyond— side with past gatekeepers who *didn't* care what they'd want, over past artists who *did*? In this light, they just might dismiss *all* of indie rock as disposable content! Luckily, BYCombo can make *your* art worthy of rediscovery— by letting you think like a future audience.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Hungry outsiders aim for the canon

Who foresaw indie rock's final stage as a trust fund playground? We did— women and minorities— which is why *we've* never started a movement to compete on self-reliance. And hip hop is no exception; rappers *proudly* rely on [labels and producers](https://genius.com/Dr-dre-nuthin-but-a-g-thang-lyrics#:~:text=Ain%27t%20nothin%27%20but,that%20pays%20me). When they boast of having hustled, they're saying, "Hey, I hustled *too*!" It's to ensure that self-reliance means *nothing*.

Yet despite the poor fit, indie rock sure is eager of late to hand us the reins! Why? Because after two decades of being no better than a foreign canon, it's in *decline*— and desperate to regain its cultural relevance. So women and minorities are being nudged onto a [glass cliff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_cliff)…

No thanks! Remember, rock and roll was founded by poor Blacks and queers, then taken further by rural Southerners, Midwestern Jews, working-class Brits… In short, it's a history of hungry outsiders. Which means women and minorities should naturally be aiming for the *historical* canon— and today we *would* be, if indie rock hadn't intervened.

Like those outsiders before us, we need to be the *most* original, the *most* talented… but this can only happen if we're allowed to rely on business partners. Hip hop gets this, which is why it *hasn't* declined; Kendrick Lamar won a [Pulitzer Prize](https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/kendrick-lamar)! Now BYCombo gives you the same chances— as a band.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Independence breeds homogeneity

Every indie gatekeeper who's met with me has drawn the same conclusion: "Sure, your [projects are impressive](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/23566)— but you're just a hobbyist." Over time I came to wonder: Shouldn't I have met one by now who *doesn't* misjudge me? Then one day it clicked: I *haven't* been rejected by a hundred gatekeepers. I've been rejected by the same one— a hundred times over!

To be interdependent, you need partners who are strong where you're weak, and vice versa— which means you value others who are as lopsided as you, but in opposite ways. Those who want independence, however, can have no real weaknesses, and thus no real strengths. They need to be well-rounded— and this leads them to converge on a single way of thinking.

So don't be fooled by indie rock's recent embrace of diversity! It doesn't sum up to any further diversity in *thought*. But BYCombo lets you find business partners who think differently… and who'll value *you* for doing the same.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Interdependence guards against prejudice

Indie rock is an ideology more than anything else— and ideologies transcend time. So why couldn't rock be indie from the *beginning*? Imagine, then, that we take a time machine back to the '50s and announce: "Artists, your success now rests solely upon building a fanbase on your own. A business partner can no longer help you!"

Every Black artist would stare glumly at us. Why? Because back then, they *needed* White partners to advocate on their behalf. Indie rock's rules would work like an artistic [poll tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poll_taxes_in_the_United_States), shutting them out in *effect*— without admitting to this *intent*. By bringing indie rock to the '50s, then… we'd look like racists. But this *wasn't* our intent! So where did we go wrong?

It's simple: Given its decentralized nature, indie rock can't guard against the prejudices of its times. It can only *reflect* them— and the '50s were openly racist! Well, is society free of prejudice today? Of course not— which is why BYCombo lets you find partners to advocate on your behalf. Because if *you* see interdependence as the great equalizer… who is anyone else to argue?

### ${++sectionCounter}. Formalized camaraderie is cronyism

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Revise. Flow into last paragraph still seems off. The point of cronyism is still kind of not really there. Maybe improve title.
`}

While indie labels do care about the bottom line, it isn't to *make* money; it's simply to ensure that they're not *losing* it. Almost every one of them began as a circle of friends who just wanted to support each other's bands— and that's how they still see themselves at heart. What's not to love? Well…

The issue is that these labels are run by society's most privileged groups— and to perpetuate inequality, the privileged *don't* need to harm others. They *just* need to [help their own](https://hbr.org/2014/01/white-people-do-good-things-for-one-another-and-thats-bad-for-hiring)— which is what any circle of friends will do! So indie rock's inequality can't be fixed at the root; its White male gatekeepers can only try to be more inclusive in whom they accept as their own.

Yet their belated push for diversity strictly helps women, not minorities— not *male* minorities, anyway. Because while all minorities struggle with stereotypes of [low warmth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_content_model), women struggle solely with stereotypes of low competence. And social justice only fixes misperceptions of competence; people are allowed to feel more warmly toward some than others.

Let's face it, camaraderie sure looks like cronyism if you're an outsider— which is why we minorities *don't* begrudge business partners their profit motive! To the contrary, [making money](https://genius.com/Wu-tang-clan-cream-lyrics#:~:text=Cash%20rules%20everything%20around%20me%0AC.R.E.A.M.,dollar%20bill%2C%20y%27all) for those who wouldn't otherwise warm to us has *always* been our ticket to acceptance— and [not *just* ours](https://genius.com/Eminem-white-america-lyrics#:~:text=When%20I%20was,under%20his%20ass). Now with BYCombo, this ticket can be yours once again.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Paid dues shrivel the noblest spirits

Mr. Rogers told us to [look for the helpers](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/198594) when times are bad. Well, times are bad in rock now… so why is no one helping? Especially from the indie camp— the "good guys"! As for me? Back in the day, I would have gladly helped to fix this broken culture— but being a nobody, I needed others to help *me* first. Yet while everyone in indie rock is nice enough… no one *helps*.

So I took a coding bootcamp, and for [seven years](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com/writings/2022/6/zillow-farewell-message), I worked days as a coder and nights on my audio webcomic. When I came back to music, I once again heard indie artists speak of paying their dues— to justify, let's say, touring at a loss. Except now it threw me, because in tech, "paid dues" is a synonym for "fake work"— and outsiders who see this, disrupt cultures that don't.

But… suddenly indie rock's lack of helpers made perfect sense! If paid dues are worthless outside the one culture that honors them, then of *course* those who've paid them will keep the culture as it is— in all its brokenness.

Moreover, once someone has wasted their best years building up symbolic credentials rather than enviable talents, they can never feel secure enough to let others surpass them. So the only newcomers they'll welcome are those willing to squander even *more* potential. But these newcomers will then feel even *less* secure— thus widening the [vicious circle](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/391717) of brokenness.

Which is why it took an outsider like myself to start BYCombo, driven by an urge to help future bands like yours surpass mine. The solution is so simple, I doubt I'm the first to think of it. Rather, I'm just the first one who's secure enough to *want* it— having never paid indie rock's dues myself.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Underdogs are supremacists in effect

Perhaps my arguments against indie rock seem moot now. After all, didn't [poptimism defeat rockism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockism_and_poptimism) a decade ago? Well, no. It was the *indie* camp who killed rock as a genre. Then, believing the death to be natural, many in this camp switched to pop. So poptimism… is just indie rock's good intentions brought over to the pop genre!

Ignore the superficial differences in sound: Indie rock and poptimism are both underdog movements that suppressed a previous culture founded by outsiders. While the former defeated the classic rock that traced its lineage to Sister Rosetta Tharpe, the latter defeated the classic pop defined by Tin Pan Alley's Eastern European immigrants.

Like indie rock, poptimism lets the underdog triumph over any outsiders— even those hungry enough to work much harder, to be much better. But this means the underdog *isn't* the best of their times… in which case, they'll also need to be *remembered* as an underdog. Yet future generations will know of every advantage they were given that was denied to the outsider!

This… *can't* be a viable way to make history. Because what historical figures from *our* past require the same cognitive dissonance of *us*? I can only think of the Ku Klux Klan and their ilk— America's original underdogs, who fought to suppress America's [original outsiders](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9648466-you-ve-got-to-be-twice-as-good-to-get-half)! Which doesn't bode well for indie rock's legacy… or poptimism's future…

Yet underdog movements will never go away— because to be seen as an underdog is a *privilege*, and the privileged will always find ways to benefit themselves. So BYCombo offers a permanent countermeasure, uniting all who favor art made by hungry outsiders— "rock and rollism," maybe?

### ${++sectionCounter}. Fair practices follow the numbers

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review.
`}

Perhaps my arguments against indie rock seem misplaced. After all, aren't the tech platforms to blame? Well, sure. But who put them in power? It was the *indie* camp. And for good reason: Every new technology in the '00s— digital downloads, streaming media, crowdfunding— was ultimately about bringing indie rock's good intentions to the Internet!

In the past, a major label would bet on visions that other labels *didn't* see— like, let's say, a regional style erupting into a global revolution. But this left artists powerless to negotiate; they couldn't pit one label against another, and a vision by itself is worth nothing. As a result, they often had to accept [unfair terms](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-music)— leading many to resent the majors as "bad guys."

By contrast, the indie labels obey the people's will— which is measured by the size of an artist's fanbase. So once *anyone* sees a safe bet, *everyone* does— and then all that's left is for one label to outbid the rest by offering the most generous terms. In other words, the way to do *right* by artists… is simply to trust the numbers! And for this, the indies get praised as the "good guys."

So when the tech platforms came along, their focus on numbers made them good guys as well. As such, the indie pundits rushed to defend file sharing: "*Real* artists earn a living by going on tour; recordings are just publicity!" And social media: "*Real* artists stick around for hours after a show, just to engage with their fans— and now they can at *any* time!"

In short, today's data-driven industry is what the [*indie* camp wanted](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/17/steve-albini-at-face-the-music-how-the-internet-solved-problem-with-music); thanks to them, even the *majors* now [require artists](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/record-labels-dig-their-own-grave#:~:text=So%20they%20demand,record%20labels%20anymore.) to build a fanbase first. The only way to revolt, then, is to reject indie rock *itself*. This is why BYCombo tells you *not* to boost your numbers— but to pursue a vision that few others see.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Longevity remains a final frontier

The best composers got *better* with age— Beethoven, for one, composed his [magnum opus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._9_(Beethoven)) in the final years of his life. But this isn't yet the case with rock bands— which means there's a whole frontier left to explore! Unfortunately… indie rock isn't cut out for this job: Hustling requires a youthful outlook, so every indie artist is destined to burn out.

By contrast, a deep love of the craft can motivate you for a lifetime. After all, to take on greater challenges, you must build your talents further— and to build your talents further, you must take on greater challenges… onward and upward, in a virtuous circle. So BYCombo keeps you in it for the long haul, by helping you stay in love with your craft.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Happiness flows from the act of creation

At the peak of my years working eighty-hour weeks— forty to earn a living, and forty on my own projects— a friend staged an intervention. "On a scale of one to ten," he asked, "how happy are you?" "Eight," I replied. He was floored; he'd expected a three. And so I cleared up the matter: The very reason I chose this path was to *guarantee* my happiness.

In his book [*Flow*](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/flow-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi), Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi explains that when you have a clear goal; feel adequately challenged; and get immediate feedback from the task at hand, you become fully immersed in the act of creation— which leads to long-term fulfillment. This is why my years of sacrifice were some of my happiest; I *wasn't* slowly killing myself, as my friend had feared.

Meanwhile, there's a [mental health crisis](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/music-and-mental-health) in music today, with artists facing high levels of anxiety and depression. Why is this? It's because any exposure gained from years of hustling might just as well be won by chance, or bought through privilege, in an instant. Every indie artist knows this, yet they play the losing game anyway… and it eats at their soul.

So yes, BYCombo tells you to focus on your craft, and to join a community of others doing the same. But this isn't *just* to make your art better! It's also for your happiness— and the good of your soul.

### ${++sectionCounter}. The simplest explanation is likely correct

To explain the squiggles traversed by the planets in their orbits around the Earth, ancient astronomers mapped out a convoluted [system of epicycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle). But once Copernicus proposed that the planets actually revolve around the *Sun*, these orbits became near circles. This was a far simpler explanation— and so by Occam's razor, it became accepted as the correct one.

Well, music today requires a similarly convoluted explanation, doesn't it? After all, the indie way is widely understood to foster the most daring art… yet *no* indie artist can match what the major labels gave us in the '90s?! And now the majors *themselves* do things the indie way… yet this *hasn't* given us the next Nirvana or Radiohead?!

But let's swap "Sun" and "Earth" in this model: What if the indie way… actually makes art… *worse*? Hey, now everything lines up! Of course, BYCombo can only get so far in proposing this far simpler explanation; to gain acceptance, it still needs strong advocates. So how about it? Will you join with the Bobtail Yearlings and be a Galileo of music?

### ${++sectionCounter}. Art needs the passion of martyrs

"Where's *our* Nirvana?" It's a question asked by today's young people. Well, there's an easy way to answer it: Can we imagine the *next* generation asking of any band today, "Where's *our* _____?" If so, then _____ is *this* generation's Nirvana. Of course, we can't— because this generation never got their own Nirvana. Why is this?

It's because we really only pine for past artists who self-sacrificed to advance the art form. But indie rock is here to *save* artists from exploitation, and so it roots for those who *empower* themselves instead. As such, indie artists today demand fair compensation; they don't self-sacrifice for *anyone*— because to do so is a classic sign of being exploited.

Yet self-empowerment comes with its own set of problems. For one, it's just [self-serving](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/14/the-ryan-adams-allegations-are-the-tip-of-an-indie-music-iceberg), [power-seeking](https://pitchfork.com/news/arcade-fires-win-butler-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-by-multiple-women-frontman-responds) behavior in those we see as underdogs; it's not noble in and of itself. For another, in a decentralized system, artists with this trait hold the *advantage*— so how are *they* the underdogs?

Worst of all, self-empowered artists will never *start* a revolution, because the means to fair compensation only get settled at the *end*. To save rock, then, we *need* to make way for bands who'll self-sacrifice to advance the art form. In other words, after Empowerment… comes the Age of Martyrdom.

Let's never go back to the days of artists dying young, of course. Thankfully, history tells of another kind of martyr: those who sacrificed not their *lives*, but their *lifetimes*. Can we imagine this generation's Nirvana being an entire *movement* of selfless bands, each one sacrificing a serious chunk of lifetime? If so, then BYCombo is here to give us the next Nirvana *now*!
