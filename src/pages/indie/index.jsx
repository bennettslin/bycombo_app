# The problem with indie rock

By the 90s, the major labels no longer invested in their bands. They simply counted on a few superstars to break out, like Nirvana and Radiohead, and then the rest were written off as failed bets. But the indie labels held to fair standards that promised *all* their bands a working future. A decade later, the majors imploded— so indie rock won! Except now…

Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com) here. I've spent half my life arguing that indie rock has made music *worse*, to no avail. But in recent years, something amazing has happened: Young people have grown disillusioned, and some now agree with me. It turns out, they'd *love* a Nirvana or Radiohead of their own. So the interdependence revolution can finally begin!

There's just one problem. Rebelling against centralized institutions is simple: Break all that we hate! But to rebel against a *de*-centralized system like indie rock, we must *build*— which is vastly more difficult. After all, build… what, exactly? Luckily, I've also spent half my life coming up with a plan:

**BYCombo will assemble interdependent bands who'll sacrifice serious chunks of lifetime to make historically consequential demos, which we'll then show in a public registry to sustain an alternative counterculture.**

### The revolution will not be decentralized

Okay, that's a mouthful! Let's break it down…

**Why an alternative counterculture?**

A counterculture is needed to protect dangerous ideas, yet we haven't had one for some time. Meanwhile, despite indie rock's good intentions, music is now worse. But what if music is worse… *because* of these good intentions? What if all this charitable support for *artists*… is actually bad for *art*? It's a dangerous idea, yet it might be rock's only hope— so let's protect it.

**Why historical consequence?**

Critical acclaim can be inflated, which makes it a terrible barometer. What *can't* be hacked is the [historical canon](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446), because making history means competing on equal terms with past artists who *didn't* rely on charitable support. In this light, it's likely that *no* indie artist today will be inducted into the canon— and *this* is why people gripe that rock is getting worse.

**Why assembled bands?**

Has rock explored all the ways a band can come together? It might seem so— assuming they'll always form on their own, in a decentralized free-for-all. But if we ditch this notion? Then rock has barely scratched the surface.

What if musicians hoping to form history-making bands could flock to a single hub from across the globe? What if a cartoonist could also join— and bands, in turn, could think to look for one? Or, suppose the next Kurt Cobain or Thom Yorke is a woman or minority who's currently struggling to attract bandmates. What if they could ask to be judged without unconscious bias?

With so many ways left to innovate in this space, there most certainly *are* canonical bands still to come. All that's needed is a centralized initiative like BYCombo to help them come together.

**Why interdependence?**

To make consequential art, a band must develop exceptional strengths. But this isn't humanly possible unless they're allowed to stay weak in areas of administration like marketing and distribution, where a *partner* can be more efficient. That is to say, history-making bands need to be *inter*-dependent, not *indie*-pendent. They *need* a label, or some other business partner.

**Why demos?**

A demo shows what a work can be in the *future*, with a partner's help. This doesn't just free a band to take creative risks; it awakens the very thought to do so— with [doublespeaker rhyme](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/4-odin/?annotation=7) being my own go-to example. Yes, artists today can self-release their works— but this is a *curse*, not a *blessing*. Past artists put out *demos*, and to compete with them means doing likewise.

**Why a public registry?**

It takes time to review an ambitious demo— but the indie labels won't put in this effort, since *any* artist they sign will be charitably supported just the same. So an interdependent band's best bet is to join a counterculture that *criticizes* indie rock's good intentions— and a public registry is where future business partners will know to find them.

**Why serious chunks of lifetime?**

Low barriers to entry have allowed an endless stream of underwhelming artists to pour through, leading people to grow wary and lose interest. But indie rock has no way to reverse this damage, given its decentralized nature.

To save rock, then, a centralized initiative like BYCombo must now step up to enforce a steep *cost* of entry. This cost can't be arbitrary or artificial, so it can only be one thing: a serious chunk of lifetime. After all, a lifetime is all you have; once that chunk is gone, it's *gone*! Which means there's nothing more precious that a band can sacrifice to restore the public's faith.

**And finally… how has indie rock made music worse?**

Here's an incomplete list of ways…

### The opportunity cost is too damn high

In the past, we of the English-speaking world rightfully claimed ours to be *the* rock canon. Our bands had no foreign peers; any who *could* match us, like ABBA, simply joined us instead. But today, indie rock feels like just another foreign canon, because indie artists *never* go above and beyond. Why don't they? It's because they're required to build a fanbase on their own.

Happily enough, building a fanbase yields compounded returns, since each fan brings in more fans. But not only that, with no talent scouts out there trying to discover artists, it's a huge disadvantage *not* to. Going above and beyond, on the other hand, yields *marginal* returns for *massive* effort— yet, by definition, it *isn't* a disadvantage simply *not* to!

What happens if a band goes above and beyond anyway, hoping to remain peerless? Add up their gains, subtract the costs, and the math is clear: They'll end up the biggest loser. No wonder we lost the canon! But with BYCombo, you can now go above and beyond to win it back.

### Revelations reward the idle mind

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Just one more final review.
`}

Indie rock requires artists to wear several hats: the marketer hat, the publicist hat… Of course, the best among them don't skimp on wearing the artist hat; they want their art to stay on par with their talents. Yet the best works are even *better* than the artists who make them. Why? Because they *also* benefit from revelatory insights that can't be summoned at will.

These insights emerge from the unconscious mind as your thoughts drift in the shower, or when you daydream out of boredom— but this can't happen if you're always context switching— or worse, multitasking. So keep your artist hat on— and let a partner wear the others. *You* want your art to be better than you, and so does BYCombo.

### The grassroots is now a lottery

We all respect those 80s indie bands for having built a grassroots fanbase, right? Yes, but also for a less spoken reason: Their stories feel deterministic to us. That is to say, these bands were always likely to succeed, because they *earned* it. They put in the work each day for untold years— unlike a one-hit wonder, who simply lucked out and won the virtual lottery.

In those days, lottery players had no patience for the grassroots; they'd sign lopsided deals with a label instead, all for a single chance at exposure. But the Internet has empowered them to reach the people directly, giving them unlimited chances— *and* making them indie artists in good faith! So now they're drowning the world in their music— *and* getting respect for it.

Naturally, bands who prefer the deterministic path can't compete like this. Yet indie rock hasn't noticed; after all, *some* artists are still building a fanbase on their own, as always! Thankfully, with BYCombo, you can once again *earn* your success, by showing up to work every day for untold years.

### Timeless art has intrinsic appeal

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review a few more times. Does the third paragraph flow well?
`}

To vie for radio airplay in the 90s, alternative bands would craft solid hooks that could win over listeners who *weren't* initially rooting for them. I was an unpopular child back then, so I knew my only hope was to develop the same knack for writing songs with [intrinsic appeal](https://youtu.be/yjJL9DGU7Gg?t=36). As such, I studied these bands closely, dreaming that one day my own band could teach others.

A while back, I sent copies of my songwriting book [*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com) to all the indie labels; I later did the same with my musical tile game *[Bobtail Dominoes](https://www.bobtaildominoes.com)*. But the labels weren't interested… and then I figured out why: Indie rock has no conception of music as a *craft*.

Because the indie labels always lost those radio-friendly bands to the majors, they learned to favor works whose artistic elements *won't* win over a radio audience, but whose [extrinsic context](https://genius.com/3669664) *can* win over discerning listeners. This context is provided by sympathetic critics, with whom the labels developed a symbiotic relationship that lives on to this day, even after radio's demise.

Yet no one cares what a past critic thought, while nearly everyone loves a past work with well-crafted hooks— and future audiences will judge *our* times the same way. Let's face it: To be timeless, works must have *intrinsic* appeal. So BYCombo gives you all the time you need to craft them.

### Creativity gets its chance from the clueless

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Just one more final review.
`}

Because the indie labels stay close to their local scenes, they're both "in the know" and "one of us." So whatever *they* like is what others like *us* have liked, which means it's the best of what *we'll* like… right? Yet according to science, it's human nature to [*dis*-like creativity](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/16/science/creativity-implicit-bias.html)!

Creative ideas are unfamiliar, and this makes us uncomfortable. Now, the corporate suits just ignore this discomfort, since it's *all* unfamiliar to them. But those in the know pride themselves on their hard-won instincts, so they interpret the discomfort as a sincere warning from their gut. Ironically, then, as [Frank Zappa noted](https://youtu.be/xP4wsURn3rw), this makes them *worse* at discovering creativity!

Which is why history's most creative artists were often backed by those with *no* prior experience in the arts. Now with BYCombo, you can once again find partners who take pride in knowing how to do business, *not* in recognizing great art.

### Middle managers join the revolution last

In his book [*Originals*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33826583), Adam Grant points out that in any business hierarchy, the ones most eager to take risks are those safely perched at the top, as well as those at the bottom with nothing to lose. Those in the middle, by contrast, are the most risk averse. And who are these risk-averse middle managers in *rock*? The indie labels.

Because indie labels have just enough standing to lose, they only make *safe* bets. And the safest bet is to deliver what the people already want. But this creates an echo chamber— the same kind that makes predictive analytics so detrimental to art. Even worse, every revolution gets nipped in the bud, because the [people *never* ask](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/988332) for what they can't envision on their own.

Revolutions may *start* with artists, but they're *spread* by business partners, whose know-how is needed to win over the public. This makes it crucial for such artists to find partners who share their appetite for risk. So BYCombo helps you reach industry executives who are well-funded enough to make *smart* bets, as well as budding entrepreneurs with no standing to lose.

### History happens by peer review

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Just one more final review.
`}

Most artists in the historical canon were superstars in their own time— but indie rock's bet is on the [long tail](https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/where-did-the-long-tail-go), which promises to kill off the superstars! So how does *any* indie artist get remembered by history? The gatekeepers have a plan: Pick one who typifies the classic underdog of our times, then rally around them. After all, who *isn't* rooting for the underdog to win?

Um… all of us other artists who *weren't* picked, that's who! To be clear, we're not [crabs in a bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality). But if a critical darling strikes us as a lottery winner, we won't pretend otherwise. And this gets at why [critics are so bad](https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/why-did-the-beatles-get-so-many-bad) at spotting history makers: They never consider how an artist looks to *other* artists.

Because artists are invested in the creative process, we don't commit false positives like the critics do: We recognize when a critical darling's talents are nothing to envy. And unlike the indie labels, we don't commit false negatives: We understand the courage it takes to propose unfamiliar ideas. In short, artists are the *only* ones who see now what historians will see in time.

Thanks to indie rock, no one today is trying to make superstars out of rock bands. Which means there's only one way left for any of us to make history: Earn the respect of our fellow *artists*. So BYCombo provides a forum for you and the other bands in your cohort to critique each other's works.

### Competitive self-reliance favors privilege

To promote self-reliance, indie rock requires artists to do the middleman's job for themselves. But a wealthy artist can just pay *others* to do it… and, well, who better to hire than a former middleman?! So indie rock has done little more than "privatize" access to business deals that were once "public"— to the benefit of the privileged. How did this happen?

The problem is that indie rock enjoys the goodwill generated by artistic movements of *cooperative* self-reliance, like the Maker Faire, that are united by love of the *craft*. But indie rock is really about *competitive* self-reliance, like libertarianism in politics; it's grounded in excitement for the *hustle*. And nothing makes the hustle easier— and thus more exciting— than privilege.

There's nothing wrong with indie rock's artistic libertarianism— but it's a *partisan* ideal that gets mistaken as *universal*. So when a band struggles to hustle because it's a poor fit for their circumstances, they're told to just suck it up and try harder. Now with BYCombo, there's an opposition party that advocates for the interdependence you want, out of respect for your craft.

### *For* hungry outsiders, *by* a hungry outsider

Who foresaw indie rock's final stage as a trust fund playground? We did— women and minorities— which is why *we've* never started a movement to compete on self-reliance. And hip hop is no exception; rappers *proudly* rely on [labels and producers](https://genius.com/3489987). When they boast of having hustled, they're saying, "Hey, I hustled *too*." It's to ensure that self-reliance means *nothing*.

Yet despite the poor fit, indie rock sure is eager of late to hand over its reins to us. Why? Because it's in *decline*! After two decades with little to show that could matter to history, indie rock today feels like just another foreign canon. So women and minorities are being led onto a [glass cliff](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/glass-cliff.asp)…

No thanks! Remember, rock and roll was founded by poor Blacks and queers, then taken further by rural Southerners, Midwestern Jews, working-class Brits… In short, it's a history of hungry outsiders. Which means women and minorities should naturally be aiming for the *historical* canon— and today we *would* be, if indie rock hadn't intervened.

Like those outsiders before us, we need to be the *most* original, the *most* talented… and so we *need* to make the best use of *mutual* reliance. Hip hop gets this, which is why it *hasn't* declined; today's rappers win Pulitzer Prizes. Now BYCombo gives you the same chances— as a rock band.

### Paid dues must now collude

For many years, I worked days as a coder and nights on my audio webcomic. When I came back to the music world, I was surprised to hear indie artists speak of paying their dues— to justify, let's say, touring at a loss. In the tech world, "paid dues" is a synonym for "fake work"— and outsiders who see this, disrupt industries that don't. But why *don't* the disrupted ever see this?

It's because paid dues are worthless outside the one system that honors them; so by nature, any such system breeds loyalty to its rule. In other words, you can pay your dues, or you can start a revolution— but never both.

Moreover, once someone has wasted their best years racking up symbolic credentials rather than actual talents, they can never feel secure enough to let others surpass them. As a result, the only newcomers they'll accept are the ones willing to squander even *more* potential. But these newcomers will then feel even *less* secure— thus perpetuating a [vicious circle](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/391717).

Which is why it took an outsider like myself to start BYCombo, driven by an urge to help future bands surpass me. My solution is so simple, I doubt I'm the first to think of it. Rather, I'm just the first artist who's secure enough to *want* it— having never paid indie rock's dues myself.

### Happiness flows from the act of creation

At the peak of my years working eighty-hour weeks— forty to earn a living, and forty on my own projects— a friend staged an intervention. On a scale of one to ten, he asked, how happy am I? Eight, I replied. He was dumbfounded; he'd expected a three. And so I cleared up the matter: The very reason I chose this path was to *guarantee* my happiness.

In his book [*Flow*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117101), Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi explains that when an artist feels challenged at just the right level while receiving continuous feedback, they become fully immersed in the act of creation— which then leads to personal fulfillment. This is why those sacrificed years were some of the happiest of my life; I *wasn't* burnt out like my friend had feared.

Meanwhile, there's a [mental health crisis](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/music-and-mental-health) in music today, with artists facing high levels of anxiety and depression. Why is this? It's because indie rock can never admit the truth: Anything gained through self-reliance might just as well be won by chance, or bought by privilege. Every indie artist knows this, yet they play the losing game anyway… and it eats at their soul.

So yes, BYCombo requires you to focus on your craft— but this isn't *just* to make your art better! It's also for your happiness, and the good of your soul.

### Art needs the passion of martyrs

"Where's *our* Nirvana?" It's a question asked by today's young people. Well, there's an easy way to answer it: Can we imagine the *next* generation asking of any band today, "Where's *our* _____?" If so, then _____ is this generation's Nirvana. Of course, we can't— because this generation never got its Nirvana. Why is that?

It's because we really only pine for past artists who self-sacrificed for art's sake. But since indie rock is here to *save* artists from exploitation, it roots for those who *empower* themselves instead. As such, indie artists today demand fair compensation; they don't self-sacrifice for *anyone*, because to do so is a classic sign of being exploited.

But the problems with this current Age of Empowerment go beyond its failure to give us the next Nirvana. For one, self-empowerment is really just self-serving, power-seeking behavior in those we see as underdogs; it's not noble in and of itself. For another, in a decentralized system, artists with this trait hold the *advantage*— so how exactly are *they* the underdogs?

Worst of all, self-empowered artists will never *start* a revolution, because the means to fair compensation get settled only at the *end*. To save rock, then, we *need* to make way for bands who'll selflessly advance the art form. In other words, after Empowerment… comes the Age of Martyrdom.

Let's never go back to the days of artists dying young, of course. Thankfully, history tells of another kind of martyr: those who sacrificed not their *lives*, but their *lifetimes*. Can we imagine this generation's Nirvana being an entire *movement* of selfless bands, each one sacrificing a serious chunk of lifetime? If so, then BYCombo is here to give us the next Nirvana *now*!
