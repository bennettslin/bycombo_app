By the '90s, the major labels were the clear "bad guys": They'd simply sign a hundred no-names to unfair contracts, hoping for a Nirvana or Radiohead to break out. But the indie labels held to fair practices, by only signing artists who already *had* a fanbase and were thus empowered *not* to need a label. A decade later, the majors imploded— so the "good guys" won! Except now…

Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://bobtailyearlings.com) here! As an Xennial, I've spent half my life arguing that indie rock's fair practices have made music *worse*— to no avail; Millennials refused to listen. The way they saw it: "Thanks to the Internet, it's easier than ever to build a fanbase on your own. And the better your works, the farther you'll go. So if you hate it… what does that say about your works?"

Thus I was left to struggle in a world that *wouldn't* speak out against indie rock. But now Gen Z is coming of age and dealing with the [same struggles](https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/2/1/24056883/tiktok-self-promotion-artist-career-how-to-build-following)— which suggests they're ready to listen. And of course… they'd *love* a Nirvana and Radiohead of their own. So let the interdependence revolution begin!

First, we raise *awareness*. Since "indie" means "good" to so many, few see the adverse effects of what I call "indiefication"— namely, our drive to propagate indie rock's founding ideals across *all* the music genres, and even all the *arts*. You know the ideals I'm talking about: cutting out the middleman, lowering the barriers to entry, rewarding direct fan engagement… and so forth.

Indiefication, seen to its logical conclusion in the online era, forces artists to put greater and greater effort into *getting* the job— or, hustling, as they say— rather than simply *deserving* it. Now, some might blame those in tech… but the tech platforms took over only by meeting *our* ideals! The problem, then, is with these *ideals*— and if you keep reading, I'll set this record straight.

From there, we take *action*. Rebelling against centralized institutions is easy, right? We just… tear them down! But against indie rock's *de*-centralized state of affairs, we must *build*— and this is far more difficult. After all, build… what, exactly? Fortunately, I've also spent half my life coming up with a plan:

**BYCombo's assembled bands will aim for the historical canon by sacrificing serious chunks of lifetime to make demos, which they'll then show in our demo registry to seek amnesty from interdependent-minded partners.**

Okay, that's a mouthful! Let's break it down…

### The revolution will *not* be decentralized

**Why amnesty?**

Thanks to Millennials, the indie tastemakers are now in charge— and since they're "good guys," the people charitably support *every* artist they pick. Yet despite good intentions all around, the arts in our times [have *declined*](https://billderesiewicz.com/books/the-death-of-the-artist). Well, what if the arts are in decline… *because* of such good intentions?!

The best of these intentions, of course, is for artists to be self-empowered enough *not* to need a label. But this forces them to divert efforts away from the craft, toward the hustle— making it a de facto *rule*, since any who *don't* will remain unknown. And yet, breaking this rule is the best way to *reverse* our decline! So why not lighten the punishment for those who try?

Unfortunately, good guys will insist that *their* rules mustn't be broken; theirs are essential to the structure— and the generation who put them in charge will agree. But what if no generation *ever* again "forgives" their rule breakers, as was done in the past? What's needed, then, is an institution to *formalize* the practice of doing so— an amnesty program for the arts, if you will.

**Why the historical canon?**

When fans support an artist, they want *content*— namely, art that engages with them directly. But while content has an advantage in the present over *past* art, it loses once its *own* time is past. To belong in the [historical canon](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446), then, today's artists must now *aim* for it— because without this conscious intent, they'll naturally settle for being content creators instead.

**Why bands?**

Indie rock encourages artists to retain their earnings— which, today, means having fewer bandmates, if any. But what competitive edge could a solo artist possibly have nowadays, to put them among the best for all *time*? From now until forever, if artists want to make history, they'll need to be greater than the sum of their parts— and in rock, this happens by forming *bands*.

**Why *assembled* bands?**

Has rock explored all the ways a band can come together? It sure seems so— assuming they'll always do so on their own, in a decentralized free-for-all. But let's ditch this notion. What if musicians hoping to form history-making bands could flock to a single hub from across the world? What if a cartoonist could also join— and bands, in turn, could think to look for one?

Or— suppose the next Kurt Cobain is a minority woman who's struggling to attract bandmates. What if she could ask to be judged free of unconscious bias? With so many ways to innovate in this space, there most certainly *are* canonical bands still to come! All that's needed is a centralized nonprofit like BYCombo to help them come together.

**Why interdependence? Why partners?**

To aim for the canon, a band must develop exceptional strengths. But this isn't humanly possible unless they also stay weak in matters of business like marketing and distribution, where a partner can be more efficient. That is to say, history-making bands need to be *inter*-dependent, not *indie*-pendent; they need to *need* a label— or some other business partner.

**Why demos?**

A demo shows what a work can be in the *future*, with a partner's help. This doesn't just free a band to take creative risks; it awakens the very thought to try— with [doublespeaker rhyme](https://yearlingsbobtail.com/4-odin/?verse=1&annotation=7) being my own go-to example. Yes, anyone today can self-release their works… but this isn't a *blessing*; it's a *curse*! Past artists put out *demos*, and to rival them means doing likewise.

**Why a demo *registry*?**

A stellar demo signifies exceptional talent— and yet, finding one requires sifting through *hundreds*. So the indie labels rarely bother, since *any* artist they sign will be charitably supported just the same. In turn, this means an interdependent band's best bet is to partner with *elites*— who alone have a "noblesse oblige" to help those being *hurt* by the people's good intentions.

But the elites have their own reason to hesitate: Anytime they release a work that sounds like a demo they once rejected, this opens them up to a lawsuit. So what we need now is a demo registry— namely, an online location where anyone can *discreetly* check out the latest bands trying to make history.

**Why serious chunks of lifetime?**

Low barriers to entry have allowed an endless stream of underwhelming artists to pour through, leading the public to grow wary and lose interest. But indie rock can't reverse this damage, given its decentralized nature. To save the arts, then, a centralized nonprofit like BYCombo must now step up and serve as a gatekeeper for the elites— by enforcing a steep *cost* of entry.

This cost can't be arbitrary or artificial, so it can only be one thing: a serious chunk of lifetime. After all, a lifetime is all you have; once that chunk is gone, it's *gone*! Which means there's nothing more precious for a band to sacrifice, in making their case for amnesty.

**And finally, how has indie rock made music worse?**

Here's an incomplete list of ways…

### ${++sectionCounter}. Nursed grievances wallow in confusion

In the '90s, "indie" referred to bands like Pavement, who'd only *ever* signed to an indie label. Since Nirvana and Radiohead were on *major* labels, this made them alternative, not indie— as Gen X knows. To Millennials, though, a band is indie if they *sound* indie… so now we're all waiting for the *indies* to give us the next Nirvana or Radiohead. Oof! How did we get confused?

Simply put, indie rock doesn't know what it stands *for*, only whom it stands *against*: the majors and their middlemen. Like MAGA, it's a culture powered by grievance— and so it shares the same weakness for confusion. After all: "Who cares if those on our side are confused in their beliefs? This is what fires them up to attack the bad guys!"

For instance, even after Goatse proved that the Internet caters to the lowest common denominator… the indie camp concluded that going viral is the new [word-of-mouth](http://archive.today/2025.03.05/https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1811-clap-your-hands-say-yeah/#:~:text=Indie%20rock%20has%20received,supposed%20to%20work!) buzz?! And when Amanda Palmer crowdfunded her way to a million dollars upon leaving a major label… this was seen as proof that artists *don't* need a label deal?!

In every early example of online success, chance or privilege played a clear role. Yet the indie camp was so eager to spurn the majors, they downplayed this point. Well, it worked: The Internet came to be seen as a meritocracy, where *anyone* can make it. Except now, if an indie artist struggles to do so… the public *has* to assume they're unworthy!

As with MAGA, then, indie rock's weakness for confusion ends up hurting its own. So yes, the majors did many things wrong— but they got Nirvana and Radiohead *right*! How? With BYCombo, you can join those of us willing to ask— because we nurse no grievances.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Populism trampled the underground

We all respect those alternative bands of the ['80s underground](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/michael-azerrad/our-band-could-be-your-life/9780316247184), right? "Yes! They were chosen by the people, *not* by the elites." Well, actually… this is yet more Millennial confusion. Back then, the underground was a shelter both for rock's underclass— who *subverted* the people's will— and for the elitist snobs who championed their works; it *wasn't* for everyone.

In the '90s, though, as bands began to leave for the major labels, "alternative" came to imply selling out; those who stayed [thus became](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=%22+alternative+rock+%22,%22+indie+rock+%22,%22+underground+rock+%22&year_start=1980&year_end=2000) "indie" instead. Yet if being indie just means *not* signing to a major, then it *can* be for everyone— so once the Internet made this possible, the indie camp argued that it *should* be. Now *anyone* who hustles to build a fanbase is considered indie!

But… this includes artists with mainstream tastes— who easily gain the most fans. Which means *they're* the ones who get picked by the indie tastemakers! Sometime in the '00s, then, indie rock was recast as a [populist movement](http://archive.today/2025.03.05/https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/6672-okkervil-river/#:~:text=I%20guess%20I,had%20%5Blaughs%5D.), as its camp went from championing the underclass— who *aren't* for everyone… to rooting for underdogs— who *can* be.

So what happens now, if *your* respect for the underground always had to do with the *aesthetics* of defying mainstream tastes, rather than the *logistics* of forgoing the majors? Why, you can rest assured: BYCombo is here to bring back elitism— the historical line of defense for subversive art!

### ${++sectionCounter}. The grassroots is now a lottery

Of course, there's another reason we respect those '80s underground bands: To come up from their local scenes— also known as the grassroots— they put in the work each day for untold years. In other words, they ensured their own legacies— unlike a one-hit wonder, who simply signed to a major label for a single chance at public exposure… and then won the "lottery," so to speak.

Thanks to online tools, though, today's lottery players get *unlimited* chances. Moreover, rather than go through the majors to spread their works from the top down, they now win the people's support from the bottom up— making the Internet our new grassroots. Which explains why we don't hear about one-hit wonders anymore: They've become indie artists in good faith!

By recasting itself as a populist movement, then, indie rock didn't just adopt the mainstream's *tastes*, but also its *indeterminacy*— where little but chance separates the few who make it from the millions who don't. But what if *you're* determined to ensure your own legacy? Then keep working on your craft for untold years— and let BYCombo expose you to the elites!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Charitable support starts an arms race

In the past, we didn't "support" artists— [outside of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_music) the *true* charity cases, like amateurs, recluses, the mentally ill… Yet today's fans will charitably support *any* artist, even superstars— a tendency known as "poptimism." How did this happen? It began when indie rock conflated personal taste with endowment for the arts, making every fan a philanthropist— a "phlan," maybe?

Unlike an arts foundation, though, phlans *don't* need to hold strict standards or be aware of unconscious bias. Their charitable support for the underdog— *any* underdog— comes from good intentions and thus can't be questioned. But then… this *isn't* just a leg up, is it? It's a winning advantage! And unlike amateurs or the mentally ill, indie artists *do* vie for all the [same honors](https://pitchfork.com/news/45374-bon-iver-wins-grammys-for-best-new-artist-best-alternative-music-album).

So indie rock set off a chain reaction, forcing the next tier of artists above to beg for support as well, and then the next… leading to our present time of poptimism, when even superstars angle to be seen as underdogs. Which is why Millennials never gave us a Shaggs or Daniel Johnston of their own: All their charitable impulses went toward defending the sure *winners*!

And yet… this obviously can't end well. We don't support artists of the *past*— and neither will future audiences. So why stoop to being a charity case today, just to be swept onto an ash heap tomorrow? With BYCombo, you can keep your dignity instead— knowing that it's the *only* way to make history.

### ${++sectionCounter}. History making is now a mere hobby

By supporting artists, then, we're both needlessly kind to the ones at the top, and cruel to those at the very bottom. "Is that so bad?" Yes, because there's a third and final effect: The history makers of our times… now get relegated to the *bottom*! To see why this is so, let's imagine a government program that promises a living wage and free health care to *every* artist.

Well… we're *all* free to make art, right? Which means the government must first separate "real" artists, who need its support, from mere hobbyists, who don't. Whatever criteria it chooses, though, will be based on the way artists have *always* worked. So anyone trying to start a *new* paradigm— to rethink how art can be made, or by whom— will be dismissed as a hobbyist!

Furthermore, it's up to each of us to decide that we've studied and practiced long enough, and now our years as a working artist may begin. But if a living wage is what's at stake, then who wouldn't want those years to begin *sooner*? Meanwhile, anyone making dense and complex works that require decades of quiet preparation… will be paying their own way the *whole* time.

To be clear, I'm not against, let's say, *universal* health care. When we support artists in *particular*, however, the ones most likely to make history… stand to gain the *least*! Fortunately, I realized this early on— having only ever been seen as a hobbyist by the indie camp. Now BYCombo helps you find partners who'd rather give amnesty to the best… than charity to all the rest.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Cultural chauvinism can only be justified

Growing up as a second-generation immigrant, I'd always known that other countries had their [own rock canons](https://youtu.be/AffEkIRKmTc). Yet because they clearly looked up to ours— the English-speaking world's— we cared little of theirs. Which made ours "the" rock canon! Especially since any band of theirs who *could* rival us, like ABBA… simply joined us instead.

So I've long understood that, to belong in the canon next to the Beatles, my band needs to be one of the best in the *world*. But the indie camp scorns my way of thinking, saying it reeks of cultural chauvinism: "Who are we to think we're better than other countries? Let a thousand canons bloom, with ours being just one of them!"

Yet this same camp will then complain that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame doesn't give [recent artists](https://uproxx.com/indie/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-bias-against-alt-indie-rock) a fair chance to get in. But unlike past inductees, today's indie artists *aren't* better than their foreign contemporaries— who have *no* chance! And so they're *not* helping to justify calling ours "the" rock canon… in which case, why would they belong in "the" Rock Hall?

Let's be honest: We're cultural chauvinists either way; all we can do is not be hypocrites as well. Thankfully, BYCombo is here to make us the world's best once more, in the only way now possible: by matching you with artists from other countries, who *could* rival you… but will join your band instead.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Talent seeks a path to stardom

By the '00s, the major labels had gutted the local scenes in their search for the next superstars. So when the Internet promised us a vibrant "long tail" decoupled from the rat race for stardom, indie rock went all in: Any artist could now flourish on the fringes! Yet today… superstars are bigger than ever, while indie artists have *lost* cultural relevance. Why is this?

For starters, the winner-take-all aspect of stardom *isn't* caused by corporate greed, but by our human nature. Since it's hard to say whose works are best, we often just like what others like— and they do the same! As a result, any [random boost](http://archive.today/2024.07.19/https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/magazine/15wwlnidealab.t.html#:~:text=The%20reason%20is,in%20her%20place.) can snowball into a winning advantage— and *this* is how the unworthy end up as superstars.

Yet stardom is also the rightful outcome for the *most* worthy artists, who naturally hope for it— even if, like Kurt Cobain, they won't admit it. So the indie camp got it backward here as well: The majors *didn't* exploit the local scenes. They simply saw the indie labels as farm teams— as did those '90s alternative bands, who signed with the indies for this very reason!

By blocking access to the majors, then, indie rock *didn't* help the most worthy artists flourish; it caused them to flee! Luckily, BYCombo is here to build a *new* path to stardom. Because, once you go above and beyond to make the best art, you *won't* just settle for a "thousand true fans." And if superstars are inevitable… then why can't *you* get a chance to be one?

### ${++sectionCounter}. Posterity is awarded by peer review

The reverse is also true, of course: Those who'd settle for a "thousand true fans" *won't* try to make the best art. Yet indie rock wants a "long tail" of such artists! So how are *any* of them expected to make history? The critics have a plan: Pick a few to represent the underdogs of our times, then rally around them. After all: "Who wouldn't root for an underdog to win?"

Um… all of us other artists who *weren't* picked, that's who! To be clear, we're not crabs in a bucket. But if a critical darling strikes us as a "lottery" winner, we won't pretend otherwise. And this gets at why [critics are so bad](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/why-did-the-beatles-get-so-many-bad) at making timeless judgments: They never consider how things look to us *other* artists.

Because we're invested in the creative process ourselves, we commit fewer false *positives*: We know when talents deemed notable are actually par for the course. And we commit fewer false *negatives*: We'll give crazy new ideas a chance, knowing the courage it takes to put them into action. In short, what historians will see in *time*… other artists [come closest](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/managers-are-not-best-judge-creative-ideas#:~:text=Berg%20attributes%20creators,ideas%20may%20succeed.%E2%80%9D) to seeing *today*.

For instance, during the Galant, a time that favored simplicity, Bach's music was derided as old-fashioned and soon forgotten by the public. Even so, his renown as a "composer's composer" grew: To learn counterpoint, [you'd study](https://bobtailyearlings.com/docs/Bach_analysis.jpg) his works. Now three centuries onward, Bach is regarded as the greatest of all time… while I've yet to meet *anyone* whose favorite style is Galant.

In essence: Ignore the critics, or any others who think that making history is a crapshoot! There *is* a reliable measure of your chances— and it's how much your talents, works, and courage inspire the envy of fellow *artists*, relative to your fame. So come join BYCombo, and surround yourself with peers who'll keep your standards high… as we wait out rock's own Galant era.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Time is kind to craft, not context

To get radio airplay in the '90s, alternative bands had to win over listeners who knew nothing about them— and the best did this by crafting chords and melodies that [hook you in](https://youtu.be/7bK5EPjGri4) with no further context. Being an unpopular teen at the time, I knew my only hope was to pull off the same. So I studied any band whose talents I envied, dreaming that one day I'd teach others.

A while back, I sent copies of my songwriting book [*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com) to all the indie labels; I later did the same with my musical tile game [*Bobtail Dominoes*](https://bobtaildominoes.com). "The best chords and melodies come through study and practice," I pointed out— but they weren't interested. In time I figured out why: It's not that they doubted my point; they just don't value music as a *craft* to begin with!

After losing too many radio-friendly bands to the major labels, the indies learned to bypass radio altogether by appealing to critics and local fans. But critics want surrounding context that can be discussed at length, while local fans— now online— like to engage directly with the artist. So both, in their own way, are drawn more to an artist's identity than to a [well-crafted hook](https://youtu.be/HWMsWO0vPa8).

Yet the past works we love most [*don't* require us](https://youtu.be/UihGpf7lCM8?t=11) to care about the artists— and future audiences will judge the works of *our* times likewise. There's no way around it: To be timeless, your music must hook in the listener on its *own*. So BYCombo gives you all the time you need to master the craft.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Mastery carries a steep opportunity cost

Millennials were the first generation whose elders embraced every genre— and as such, they rebelled in the only way they thought possible: by ironically celebrating the [most *middling*](https://bennettsamuellin.blogspot.com/2013/05/undoing-stupid-damage.html) works. As a result, today's artists don't *need* to be the best. But… can't one try anyway, to rival *past* artists who met the high expectations of *previous* generations? Well, let's examine their options.

They can hustle to build a fanbase— which yields *compound* returns, as each fan brings in new fans. Plus, with no talent scouts trying to discover them, it's a huge disadvantage *not* to. Or— they can go above and beyond to make the best art, which yields *diminishing* returns for every *increase* in effort. Yet, by definition, it *isn't* a disadvantage simply not to!

It's obvious, then, why music was better before indie rock took over: The *only* option was to try and be the best. So… what if *you* were to do just that? Add up the gains, subtract the costs, and the math is clear: You'd be the biggest loser. Fortunately, the only way now for *Gen Z* to rebel… is by sincerely celebrating the most *masterly* works! And with BYCombo, they can know of yours.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Serendipity rewards the idle mind

Are you unconvinced that music is now worse? Then ask this about any of the latest artists: Whatever their best work might be, could they *guarantee* us another one just as good? I suspect we'll agree: The answer is yes. That is to say, even the best works today simply *match* the talents of those who make them; they're what I call "workhorse art."

By contrast, could Dolly Parton *reliably* compose one "[Jolene](https://youtu.be/Ixrje2rXLMA)" after another? Or [Stephen Sondheim](https://bobtailyearlings.com/docs/Sondheim_paper.pdf), "[Someone in a Tree](https://youtu.be/JpoKuNyVNhQ)"? It's doubtful. These are what I call "windfall art"— namely, works that are even *better* than those who make them. In fact, some of them seem to surpass what's humanly possible at *all*— and for this reason, they're the kind that fellow artists envy most.

Of course, the best artists *are* human— so how are such works possible? It's because they *don't* benefit from talents alone, but *also* from creative insights that emerge from the unconscious mind and can't be summoned at will. In other words, spend enough time letting your [thoughts drift](https://paulgraham.com/top.html#:~:text=I%20suspect%20a,to%20change%20something.) in the shower, or daydreaming out of boredom… and the next "Jolene" just might be *yours*!

But this can't happen if you're always context switching— which explains why "indiefication" has made music worse. Indie artists *endlessly* switch between multiple hats: the promoter hat, the publicist hat… So keep your artist hat on, and have partners wear the others. Because *you* want your works to be better than you— and so does BYCombo.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Modest standing leads to risk aversion

In his book [*Originals*](https://adamgrant.net/book/originals), Adam Grant points out that in any hierarchy, the ones eager to take risks are those securely perched at the top, as well as those at the bottom with nothing to lose. The ones in the middle, by contrast, are the most risk-*averse*. Which explains why indie rock is so *un*-original: Its artists *seek* greater standing while its labels *cede* it— so *no one* takes any risks!

Historically, artists lacked all means to get themselves known to the public, freeing them to explore at will— and sometimes leading to unexpected ideas. Today, however, indie artists follow all the tricks to gain fans from day one— leaving them reluctant to experiment, for fear of losing those fans.

Meanwhile, the major labels in their heyday would cast a wide net for talent, which allowed them to take greater risks, and thus reap [greater rewards](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskreturntradeoff.asp). But a bigger roster can also be a [more diverse](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/importance-diversification) one— so, funny enough, this *also* led them to give us the boldest art… by encouraging them to pick unknown artists with unexpected ideas!

By contrast, the indie labels sign just one artist at a time, so they go with the safe bet, *every* time, of simply picking what the people want. But people only want what they [know to expect](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/988332-some-people-say-give-the-customers-what-they-want-but)… thus creating an echo chamber! This is why BYCombo lets you explore and experiment, while you have no fans to lose: It makes you the *smart* bet, for those seated high— or low!— enough to see it.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Creativity gets its chance from the clueless

In the past, the indie tastemakers stayed close to their local scenes, making them both "in the know" and "one of us." And now online, they offer the same assurance: What they like is what others like *us* have liked— which means it's what *we'll* like. What's not to like? Well… in *my* case, this is what led them to reject *Yearling's Bobtail*— my "*Ulysses* of rock albums"!

What confused me is that I'd explicitly set out to make a [work of art](https://yearlingsbobtail.com/8-good-night-sita/?verse=61&annotation=40) whose creativity [*can't* be disputed](https://yearlingsbobtail.com/10-constellations/?verse=1&annotation=9). Only later did it hit me: If a tastemaker is one of *us*, then this is the *last* thing they'd want— since it's the last thing *we* want. Our human nature is to [*dis*-like creativity](http://archive.today/2024.08.26/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/16/science/creativity-implicit-bias.html); we just don't realize this, because whatever it is we *do* like… we simply call *that* the thing that's creative!

Creative ideas are unfamiliar, and this makes us uncomfortable. Now, the "corporate suits" just ignore the discomfort, since it's *all* unfamiliar to them. But those in the know pride themselves on their hard-won intuition, so they interpret the discomfort as a sincere warning from their gut. Ironically, then, as [Frank Zappa noted](https://youtu.be/xP4wsURn3rw), this makes them *worse* at discovering creativity!

Consequently, it's often those with the [*least* experience](https://youtu.be/AClN5X0eEvI) in a given genre who end up backing its canonical works: Since they *don't* know what the people want, they *can't* be led astray! Let's face it, the best partners take pride in doing good business, *not* in knowing great art. Now with BYCombo, you can find one to back you once again.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Limited bandwidth fails to adapt

Can the indie labels learn *not* to be led astray? No, they're overworked and underpaid— and this is exactly their selling point: By *not* hiring middlemen, they pass the savings onto their artists. To conserve bandwidth, then, they simply follow the instincts that worked well for their forebears… much like moths, which evolved to [orient themselves](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/jan/30/why-are-moths-attracted-to-lights-science-answer#:~:text=moths%20and%20many,they%20flew%20level.) by starlight.

Of course, these instincts made sense in the '80s, when underground bands built a fanbase by playing local shows. For instance, it's precisely *because* word of mouth only traveled locally that the indies came to value it so highly. And likewise with their respect for direct fan engagement: Back then, it was only *ever* possible with a local gathering.

But today, algorithms have turned word of mouth into wisdom of the crowd— which settles on an average by canceling out the extremes. And social media has made engaging with fans trivial; those who do so now might enjoy *fame*, but never *acclaim*. Yet the indies haven't noticed! Like moths circling around a flame, they're stuck with outdated instincts in a modern world.

So yes, middlemen might seem redundant— but redundancy is what keeps a system resilient, and thus [able to adapt](https://www.forkingpaths.co/p/against-optimization#:~:text=Optimizing%20for%20efficiency,bet%20for%20humanity.)! Unfortunately, even the major labels are on a tight budget now, leading them to behave more like the indies. This is why BYCombo tells you to split your earnings generously: How else will you find partners who *aren't* too harried to change with the times?

### ${++sectionCounter}. Disintermediation is a middleman's wish

To help artists cut out the middleman, indie rock provides them with tools to do the middleman's job for themselves. Of course, the "Bizarro" way would be to empower *middlemen* to do the *artist's* job. Absurd, right? Yet the outcome would be exactly the same, with each person now doing the job of both artist *and* middleman. So indie rock… is its own Bizarro world!

And here's more absurdity: Whereas artists are loved for doing what we'd all rather do, middlemen are hated for taking on work that few others enjoy. In this new hybrid role, then, an artist *has* to be their own middleman… but a middleman *gets* to be their own artist. So "indiefication" is really the wish of a *middling* artist— who'd otherwise only qualify to *be* a middleman!

Let's be clear: The best artists *value* the middleman. After all, when you're the best at your job, it's a waste of your talents to do anyone else's— and knowing that your own job is harder than it looks, you have to assume the same of everyone else's. Plus, as one of the best yourself, you get your pick of the best partners. It's called division of labor; we learned this in middle school!

Sadly, young folks never question today's auto-Bizarro world, since it's all they've ever known. But I came of age *before* indie rock took over, so I've only *ever* dreamt of having one job as an artist— seeing that there's no other way to make the best art! Now with BYCombo, this dream can be yours as well.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Self-reliance is a partisan ideal

Want even *more* absurdity? Any rich artist can simply pay *others* to do the middleman's job for them… and, well, who better to hire than a freelance middleman?! So in the end, indie rock has done little more than "privatize" access to business deals that were once a "public good"— to the benefit of the privileged. How did this happen?

Simply put, indie rock is widely seen as a do-it-yourself movement— the kind that fosters *cooperative* self-reliance by instilling a [love for the craft](https://makerfaire.com). As such, it meets with no opposition and enjoys all the same goodwill. Now, this *would* be fitting… if indie artists only made music for their *own* fulfillment.

But being indie is all about gaining public exposure, and this is a zero-sum game: When attention is paid to one artist, it *isn't* being paid to the rest. So the indie camp is really about *competitive* self-reliance! Like libertarians in politics, they want "doing it yourself" to be how you even survive at *all*— and having privilege is the [greatest predictor](https://www.cracked.com/article_40871_penn-jillette-wants-to-talk-it-all-out.html#:~:text=Many%20times%20when,100%20percent%20accurate.) of this belief.

The problem, then, is that indie rock's cultural libertarianism is a *partisan* ideal that gets mistaken as *universal*; thus an "opposition party" has never arisen. So how do we start one? Here's a clue: In Ayn Rand's *Atlas Shrugged*— a novel popular with libertarians— the business world's "indie camp" goes on strike against nationalization by *refusing* to help society advance.

To protest against "indiefication," then, interdependent bands can do the opposite, and *readily* advance the art form… knowing this might hurt their *own* prospects! So ignore those who'd advise you to be self-reliant, saying there's just no other path. There is one *now*, with BYCombo— the culturally progressive opposition that shares your love of the craft.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Mutual reliance creates wealth

In game theory, the "stag hunt" is a game in which you and another player must decide, each on your own, whether to hunt hares separately, or team up and hunt a stag together. The stag yields far more meat, even when split two ways. But if you trust the other player and go for the stag— only for *them* to doubt *you* and thus stick with hares— you'll end up with nothing.

The richest nations build systems that allow their citizens to trust each other and confidently "hunt the stag," creating more wealth for all. The reverse is also true: North Korea, a poor nation, leaves its citizens to "hunt hares"— and fittingly, its [state ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche) translates to "self-reliance." Well, now you know where this is going: Indie rock… is the North Korea of music!

Indie artists work hard *not* to need a label, and will do so even [when signed](http://archive.today/2024.05.11/https://pitchfork.com/news/34979-amanda-palmer-tells-roadrunner-records-please-drop-me/#:~:text=I%27ve%20built%20up,totally%20DIY%20operation.) to one— on the label's dime! So labels have learned to doubt artists as well… destroying the mutual reliance needed to create cultural wealth. Yet there's hope: Much like South Korea shows how North Korea might one day flourish, the past proves that rock can be interdependent once again!

BYCombo just needs artists like you, who *want* to need a label, to join with the Bobtail Yearlings and go for the stag, over and over— despite ending up with nothing, again and again— until others finally [reciprocate the courage](http://archive.today/2024.05.11/https://slate.com/culture/2007/09/the-obscure-game-theory-problem-that-explains-why-rich-countries-are-rich.html#:~:text=One%20worrying%20outcome,regain%20once%20lost.) to partner with us. Yes, it's the definition of insanity… but to stick with hares is to live in cultural poverty forever. So how about it?

### ${++sectionCounter}. Democratization causes noise pollution

To "democratize" Twitter, Elon Musk made the blue checkmark available to all paid accounts; he wanted *everyone* to have a voice, not just those verified under [legacy criteria](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587498907336118274). Well, guess who else thinks this way: the indie camp! They want *every* artist to be heard, not just those "verified" by a label— and so they encourage the use of online tools that offer all the same benefits.

Here's the problem, though: Once a mark of verification is easy to attain, it ceases to be an honest signal. We can no longer assume that those who have it are worth hearing from. Moreover, the field gets "polluted" by *dis*-honest signaling from the *least* worthy, who'd rather hustle to *get* the job, than work to *deserve* it. Seems bad, right? Yet it's even worse…

You see, pollution is an example of the famous "prisoner's dilemma," where each player must decide: To squeal or not? Similarly, then, democratization requires each artist to decide: To hustle or not? We're all better off if *no one* hustles, of course. But once *anyone* does, they'll hog up all the attention. So now *every* artist must waste time and energy on the hustle!

To complicate matters, this is what's called a collective action problem: It's caused by individuals acting in their own interest— and so the solution *has* to come from top-down coordination. Yet the indie camp's way of thinking is bottom up; under their watch, change can *only* take place at the grassroots. Which means they'll never clean up this mess they've created…

The lesson here, then, is that low barriers to entry *don't* lead to democracy, but to "indieocracy"— or, rule by those who hustle to get themselves known. So what happens now, if *your* dream all along was to be *made* known, by the elites? Why, you can verify your worth by paying BYCombo's steep *cost* of entry: a serious chunk of lifetime!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Audiences put to labor simply leave

Imagine this argument: "When I play sports, it doesn't just benefit *me*; it also benefits *you* to watch me. Yet I don't make minimum wage… while superstars earn millions! So let's get rid of overpaid talent scouts, and empower indie athletes like me to get ourselves known. Yes, this will crowd the field— but you'll just have to put in the work to find what you want. Who'd object?"

Uh… *we* would— the audience! Most of us only want the *best* athletes, and it's the *talent scout's* job to find them, not *ours*. If "indie sports" took over, then, we'd quietly turn to serial dramas or video games, and only ever come back for "classic sports" reruns. Right? Okay, well… indie rock *did* take over. So how come no one can figure out why the audience for music [is leaving](https://youtu.be/Ag4iFa6E_yY)?!

But there's hope: While Millennials were active creators from day one, Gen Z reverted to being passive consumers once the Internet consolidated. As with Boomers and Gen X, then, Gen Z empathizes foremost with the *audience*— having first been one themselves. Which means today's pro-*artist* thinking might just be a generational fluke… and *not* the future of music.

Still, how do we become pro-*audience* once more? First, we remind ourselves that, as a figure of speech, the word "audience" has strayed far from its literal meaning of "those who attend the performance of a work." So let's use it once more in a way that Bach— who made music for God!— would've understood: An audience *isn't* a fanbase; nor are they a following.

From there, we admit that the silent majority only want the *best* artists— and *not* the job of knowing [what this entails](https://youtu.be/SYSa4RzaH80)! Fortunately, BYCombo promises to be an effective gatekeeper, if you'll pledge to make the best art— namely, the kind of works that *you'd* care to study or enjoy most, if you were anyone else, out of all that's come before and all else that's out there.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Hustlers lack a theory of future minds

Nick Drake was ignored in his own time— yet the next generation made him known to history. Did they need to see him hustle? No, they simply judged his works. So there's a lesson here for all tastemakers: To discover artists that future audiences will want to *re*-discover, just… [think like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind) a future audience.

In the past, the major labels did just that: Their talent scouts would sign any artist on the strength of a stellar demo— even one with no fanbase, like Nick. But indie rock's rule is for artists to get themselves known, whether or not they deserve to be. Because of this, the notion is now vulgar that those who don't hustle could ever be *made* known… simply by deserving to be.

Let's imagine, though, that you *refuse* to hustle; you've tried it before, and it feels awful— like being a pickup artist would. Because, sure, such cynical ploys *can* work… but *should* they? We've all heard of negging by now, and pretty much everyone hates the idea. In which case, why wouldn't society come to feel the same about artists milking [free labor](https://exiledfan.substack.com/p/revenge-of-the-stans#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20easy%20to,Swifties%20Unionize%E2%80%9D%20prank.) out of their fans?

So instead, you build yourself up to be what a future audience— or dating prospect!— *would* want, based on theories that you revise and refine over time. Which… is also more fun and rewarding for *you*, right? Yet from what I've seen, the indie tastemakers will never "forgive" your defiance. They're loyal to the hustlers— having hustled to get where they are themselves!

But why would the next generation side with past tastemakers who *didn't* care what they'd want, over past artists who *did*? In this light, they just might dismiss *all* of indie rock as disposable content! Luckily, BYCombo can make *your* art worthy of rediscovery— by letting you think like a future audience.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Welfare gets cut by past beneficiaries

Social welfare is straightforward, right? After giving us all a fair chance, the government taxes each of us at a rate proportionate to our success… which then subsidizes the same opportunities for the next generation. But welfare for artists is tricky, since— as we've seen— no government program is likely to give our history makers a fair chance.

So what *should* artistic welfare look like? Basically, a centralized institution must first cast a wide net, then take from the earnings of a successful few, to subsidize the same opportunities for the next generation of artists. But… this is how the major labels worked in their heyday, no? Promoting welfare in the arts, then, is simply the *smart* move— for any business with a profit motive!

Unfortunately, *all* welfare is fragile: Rather than be grateful to get a chance at all, the unsuccessful tend to resent not being given *more* support… while the successful often assume they would've done just fine on their own, and thus resent "paying it forward." So libertarians— including the cultural kind found in indie rock— have no trouble turning the people against welfare.

Yet others *happily* pay it forward: "Paying more means we [succeeded more](https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/warren-buffett-greg-abel-succeeded-ceo-berkshire-1236316306/#:~:text=So%20thank%20you,They%20deserve%20better.)!" It's the noble way of thinking, for sure; but isn't it also better… for *you*? So if you miss those legacy institutions that promised to subsidize your chances— in exchange for *your* promise to do the same for others— BYCombo can help you find partners who'll make the smart move once again.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Paid dues shrivel the noblest spirits

Mr. Rogers told us to [look for the helpers](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/12135721-when-i-was-a-boy-and-i-would-see-scary) when times are bad. Well, times are bad in rock now… so why is no one helping? Especially from the indie camp— the "good guys"! As for me? Back in the day, I'd have *gladly* helped to fix this broken culture. It's just that "noblesse oblige" has to come from a somebody; being a nobody, I needed others to help *me* first. Yet no one would help…

So I took a coding bootcamp, and for [seven years](https://bobtailyearlings.com/writings/2022/6/zillow-farewell-message), I worked days as a coder and nights on my audio webcomic. When I came back to music, I once again heard indie artists speak of paying their dues— to justify, let's say, touring at a loss. Except this time it threw me, because in tech, "paid dues" is a synonym for "fake work"— and outsiders who see this, disrupt cultures that don't.

But… now the indie camp's lack of noblesse oblige made perfect sense! If paid dues are worthless outside the one culture that honors them, then *of course* anyone who's already put in the hustle will want to keep indie rock as it is— in all its brokenness.

Moreover, once someone has wasted their best years building up symbolic credentials rather than enviable talents, they can never feel secure enough to let others surpass them. So *of course* the only newcomers they'll help are those willing to squander even *more* potential. But these newcomers will then feel even *less* secure— thus widening the [vicious circle](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/391717-steve-jobs-has-a-saying-that-a-players-hire-a) of brokenness.

Which is why it took an outsider like myself to start BYCombo, driven by an urge to help future bands, like yours, surpass mine. My solution is so simple, I doubt I'm the first to think of it. Rather, I'm just secure enough to *want* it— having never hustled to pay indie rock's dues myself.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Hungry outsiders aim for the canon

"Who could've foreseen any downside from promoting indie rock's ideals?" Um… us women and minorities, that's who! This is why *we've* never started a movement to compete on self-reliance. And hip hop is no exception: Rappers *proudly* rely on [labels and producers](http://archive.today/2024.05.11/https://genius.com/Dr-dre-nuthin-but-a-g-thang-lyrics#:~:text=Ain%27t%20nothin%27%20but,that%20pays%20me). When they boast of having hustled, it's to say, "Hey, I hustled *too*!" They want self-reliance to count for *nothing*.

Yet despite the poor fit, indie rock sure is eager of late to hand us the reins! Why? Because, after two decades of effectively being just another foreign canon, it's in *decline*— and desperate to regain its cultural relevance. So we women and minorities are being nudged onto a "[glass cliff](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/glass-cliff.asp)"…

No thanks! Remember, rock and roll was founded by poor and queer Blacks, then taken further by rural Southerners, Midwestern Jews, working-class Brits… In short, it's a history of hungry outsiders. Which means women and minorities should naturally be aiming for the *historical* canon— and today we *would* be, if indie rock hadn't intervened.

Like those outsiders before us, we need to be the *most* original, the *most* talented… but this can only happen if we're allowed to depend on partners. Hip hop gets this, which is why it *hasn't* declined; Kendrick Lamar just won a Pulitzer Prize! Now BYCombo gives your band the same chances.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Capitalism is the cure for cronyism

The word "alternative" describes an *artistic* choice; and "indie," a *business* stance. Until the '90s, then, *artists* weren't indie, only *labels* were. And that stance? It says, "We don't do this for the money." Indeed, many indie labels started as a circle of friends who just wanted to support each other's bands— and this is how they still see themselves at heart. What's not to love? Well…

The issue is that these labels are run by society's most privileged groups— and to perpetuate inequality, the privileged *don't* need to harm others. They *only* need to [help their own](https://hbr.org/2014/01/white-people-do-good-things-for-one-another-and-thats-bad-for-hiring#:~:text=Whites%20don%E2%80%99t%20have,all%20the%20time.)— which is what any circle of friends will do! So indie rock's inequality can't be fixed at the root; its White male tastemakers just have to be more inclusive in whom they accept as their own.

But so far, their efforts have only helped women, not us minorities— or *male* minorities, anyway. Why? Because our struggles *aren't* the same. Minorities [face stereotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_content_model) of low *warmth*; and women, of low *competence*. Yet social justice, when self-enforced, *only* fixes misjudgments of competence; a circle of friends has every right to feel more warmly toward their own.

You'll notice, then, that we minorities *aren't* ones to begrudge a business partner their profit motive! To the contrary, making money for those who wouldn't otherwise warm to us has *always* been our ticket to acceptance— and [not *just* ours](http://archive.today/2024.05.11/https://genius.com/Eminem-white-america-lyrics#:~:text=When%20I%20was,under%20his%20ass). Now with BYCombo, this ticket can be yours once again.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Elitism is the great equalizer

While indie artists seek populist solidarity, rappers revel in [elitist snobbery](https://youtu.be/78SV9tguyVM). Yet for Gen X, it's the rapper who represents the *true* face of disadvantage! How so? Think about it: When millions want what few can have, competition *must* happen, one way or another— and with this being the case, those with no advantages would prefer it to happen in plain sight.

Because Millennials grew up with so many advantages, however, they fail to grasp how the *truly* disadvantaged behave in the face of competition— much like [being unskilled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect) keeps you from noticing greater skill in others. So when they see bands call for elitist gatekeeping the way rappers do, they decry it as "rockism"— implying that such snobbery is akin to racism.

But once competition takes place *away* from the public eye— as populism demands it should— the disadvantaged have no way to counter the hidden advantages of others: being born rich, having industry know-how or insider connections, benefiting from legacy institutions in the past… and so on. No wonder, then, that indie rock is [now a playground](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2316349-parent-names-are-blue-on-wikipedia) for the privileged!

Which explains why the disadvantaged tend to be *put off* by populism: It asks them to celebrate a [privileged artist's wins](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/an-open-letter-to-taylor-swift#:~:text=So%20who%20will,and%20have%20won!) as their own— while toppling the elites who represent their one hope to secure such wins themselves. And so we often get a "sideways horseshoe," in which the underclass at the bottom feels closer to the elites at the top, than to all others in the middle.

Thankfully, *I've* never taken to indie rock's ideal of populist solidarity; as a minority Xennial, I much prefer hip hop's penchant for elitist snobbery— "rappism," maybe? Because public exposure *is* a zero-sum game, like it or not. Now BYCombo lets you treat it as such… just like rappists always have.

### ${++sectionCounter}. True progressives join the establishment

In high school, a classmate referred to the carpetbaggers as "bad guys"— for having exploited the defeated South. This surprised me, since I saw them as "good guys"— for having defended vulnerable Blacks. Clearly, he sided with the people, while I sided with the elites and the underclass. So this model of a "sideways horseshoe" shows up not just in culture… but in politics as well!

Now, our forebears didn't need to coin such a term; they intuitively grasped why the underclass should distrust populism— the [New Deal](https://wwnorton.com/books/When-Affirmative-Action-Was-White), anyone?— but we've since lost this intuition. As a result, progressive Millennials keep trying to pit *all* of us against the elites of the political establishment… only to watch in confusion as the disadvantaged among us side with those [elites instead](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/2016-clinton-sanders-black-voters-pick-winner-n1029631).

Of course, it isn't just in politics, but also in culture, where this confusion has made Millennials so ineffectual. For instance, as a minority artist, I do better trying to win the minds of a few elites, rather than the hearts of the crowd. Yet the indie camp— their generation's good guys— won't hear of it. It's like they think I'm voting against my own interests!

Which explains why both culture *and* politics have gotten worse in our times: In each case, Millennials keep mistaking populism for progressivism— when they're *not* the same! A populist *patronizes* the disadvantaged for wanting to join the establishment, whereas a progressive *sympathizes*— and thus sees wisdom in joining as well.

Will Democrats become a party of the sideways horseshoe, then, much like those early Republicans? I don't know enough to say. But I'm *fully* qualified to predict a return of the sideways horseshoe… in *rock*! Because BYCombo lets those of you in the underground join the establishment once again— even if, like Kurt Cobain, you'd never admit to this dream.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Countercultures shelter today's losers

Rappers love to bash the "wack MC"; as outsiders, they know that kindness to the audience means cruelty to worse artists. But the indie tastemakers *can't* be cruel; they're "good guys"! So rather than weed you out for being wack— a harsh indictment of who you *are*— they merely dismiss you as a hobbyist if you didn't hustle— a plain measure of whether you've paid your dues.

Yet as W. David Marx observes in his book [*Status and Culture*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/659558/status-and-culture-by-w-david-marx), every culture creates its own status hierarchy. Which means the one created by indie rock *isn't* the same as, let's say, that of the '90s alternative culture from which Radiohead emerged— even if they overlap. There are new winners, but also new losers— such as "hobbyists," who now sit at the bottom.

And this should concern us, since Radiohead… were the ultimate hobbyists! They'd never hustled in their *lives*. Upon signing to a major label based on a stellar demo, they were told to change their name from On a Friday— and they *did*, to no confusion, as they were so little known in their local scene. There just wasn't any recourse: The indie labels didn't want them!

But can't *today's* indies learn to sign the *next* Radiohead? No, because status plays out unconsciously; no one *conspires* to enforce its hierarchy— so there are no minds to change. Our human nature is simply to *admire* whichever traits enable whomever to win, by whatever the rules are… and if the rule is to get yourself known, then the winning trait is a knack for the hustle.

Still, the losers have one recourse: to start a *counter*-culture… that just might let them be *tomorrow's* winners! Yet none has arisen, because: "Why counter the good guys?" Fortunately, as this century's biggest loser, I've spent half my life plotting to start one. Now with BYCombo, you too can hope for amnesty, after betting it all on the craft— your low-status "hobby."

### ${++sectionCounter}. Independence breeds homogeneity

"Be so good they [can't ignore you](https://youtu.be/jTdXqsrs4oI)," Steve Martin advises. Well… I thought I'd done just that, given the scope of my projects— including [amnesticism](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/23566), my theory for composing multidimensional works. Yet every indie tastemaker I've met with has written me off as a hobbyist… despite *seeming* impressed. So I used to wonder: Shouldn't *one* have given me a chance by now?

Then one day it clicked: I *haven't* met with a hundred indie tastemakers. For all intents and purposes, I've only ever met with the same one— a hundred times over! After all, being independent means having no weaknesses, and thus no real strengths. As a result, everyone in indie rock converges on the same well-rounded way of thinking…

Moreover, just like each person gets one vote in a democracy, each work gets one chance in an "indieocracy." So artists converge on the same strategy of putting out many on a steady basis, leading them all to make the same *kind* of work— namely, "workhorse art." Yet the indie labels don't mind; since they sign just one artist at a time, a well-rounded one is the safe bet *every* time…

Still, what if *your* dream is to make "windfall art," which *requires* you to be exceptionally strong in the ways of art, and thus hopelessly weak in matters of business? Then let BYCombo help you meet partners who are as lopsided as you, but the other way around— because they value interdependence as much as you do!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Interdependence guards against prejudice

Indie rock's ideals are based on *ethics*, not *aesthetics*— and ethics transcend time. So why couldn't rock be indie from the *beginning*? Imagine, then, that we take a time machine back to the '50s and announce, "Artists, as your own best advocate, you'll now be judged by how far you get on your *own*, without the help of a partner. The playing field is finally level!"

Every Black artist would stare glumly at us. Why? Because, back then, they *needed* White partners to advocate on their behalf. Indie rock's rules would work like an artistic poll tax, shutting them out in *effect*— without admitting to this *intent*. By bringing indie rock to the '50s, then… we'd look like racists. But this *wasn't* our intent! So where did we go wrong?

It's simple: Historically, victims of prejudice relied on centralized authorities to *subvert* the people's will. During the civil rights movement, for example, the federal government had to force the Southern states to end segregation. But indie rock promises to *obey* the people's will by *de*-centralizing the arts— which means it will always uphold the prejudices of its times.

Well, is society free of prejudice today? Of course not. Yet no one noticed me staring glumly when indie rock took over… So what happens now, if *your* life experiences, like mine, have repeatedly shown that you *aren't* your own best advocate? Why, BYCombo can help you find partners who'll advocate on your behalf— as we usher in a new time of civil rights for artists!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Identity is a resort of the privileged

Let's be fair: In wanting to be judged on the self-reliance that comes easily to them, White men *don't* know they're trading on their privilege; they really *do* think it helps all of us. But this is why they *didn't* blame their own ideals when "nepo babies"— for whom it's even *easier*!— took the lead in the '00s. Instead, they leaned harder on our affection for them as [society's underdogs](http://archive.today/2021.06.04/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/magazine/black-keys-blues.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFor%20me%2C%20it,aspirations%20we%20did.%E2%80%9D).

Except… it turns out, this *too* is a hidden advantage that's largely theirs alone! By the '10s, then, indie rock was overwhelmingly White and male. Suffering a [crisis of conscience](https://slate.com/culture/2012/08/pitchforks-peoples-list-is-almost-exclusively-white-and-male-this-is-a-scandal.html), the indie camp solved this problem in the only way they knew how: by allowing us women and minorities to be seen as underdogs as well— a solution that's come to be called "wokeness."

But while White men *easily* benefit from their identities without admitting to it— by presenting a [timeless backstory](http://archive.today/2025.03.05/https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15551-bon-iver/#:~:text=The%20guy%20who,write%20some%20songs), for example— we women and minorities can do so only by *blatantly* pointing to our race or gender… for which society *doesn't* feel the same affection! So wokeness has provoked a backlash, as MAGA now attacks it from the political right.

Yet such attacks are doomed to fail. How do I know? Because, when the indie labels first rejected me in the '00s, I *myself* flirted with joining the right— to snub the indie camp, who mostly sit on the political left. But I couldn't get my arguments to line up… until it hit me: Greater *indie*-pendence is a demand of the *right*; in terms of *culture*, it's *I* who sit on the left— and *they*, the right!

To gain from one's individual identity, then, is a *right*-wing ideal— as are all of indie rock's other ideals, along with most ideals favored by the privileged. It's the cultural *right* that's been ascendant this whole time! But now you can join the cultural *left*, and help BYCombo promote the one ideal favored most by the disadvantaged: to benefit from our collective *inter*-dependence.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Penultimate tolerance hides a pitfall

No, Silents weren't rooting for a Black crooner… but this is *exactly* why they embraced Sammy Davis Jr.! They knew he had only one lifeline, like every hungry outsider before him: to try much harder, to be much better than all others. He did just that— so they kept their end of the bargain. Similarly, we Xennials didn't want a White rapper… but then we embraced Eminem.

Yet when I came along— trying much harder, to be much better— no indie tastemaker respected or sympathized with my approach. Why? My guess is it's because Millennials were the first generation to believe they'd achieved perfect tolerance. As such, they decided that, henceforth, society's age-old bargain with the hungry outsider was to be null and void.

Thus I had *no* lifeline— and then, as it happens, Millennials *weren't* perfectly tolerant. Which is why indie rock was largely White and male for so long! Yet even in a *perfectly* tolerant future, we'll *still* root for some over others, based on height, looks, [place of origin](https://twitter.com/Steven_Hyden/status/1708868954741977173)… and so forth. If we're to live with ourselves, then, we *must* throw a lifeline to those we don't root for.

There's also a selfish reason to do so: Once we shut out the outsiders of our times, we can no longer deflect any claim that music got worse under our watch— a claim that history will surely make against Millennials! Luckily, if you're hungry enough to try much harder, to be much better, BYCombo can help Gen Z honor that age-old bargain once more.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Underdogs are supremacists in effect

Perhaps my arguments against indie rock seem moot, now that "poptimism" has defeated "rockism." After all, doesn't this mean that pop killed rock? Well, no; the *real* killer was "indiefication." Unaware of their complicity, however, many in the indie camp then sought to be of use elsewhere. So poptimism… is really just indie rock's good intentions brought to the pop genre!

Ignore the superficial differences in sound: Indie rock and poptimism are both underdog movements that supplanted a previous culture founded by outsiders. For the former, it was rock and roll, whose lineage traces to Sister Rosetta Tharpe; and for the latter, the classic pop defined by Tin Pan Alley's European immigrants.

Both movements protect the chosen underdog by refusing to ask: "Wouldn't the rejected outsider— who tries much harder, to be much better— take us *farther*?" But if an underdog *isn't* the best of our times, then they'll also need history to *remember* them as the underdog. Yet future generations will know of every advantage they were given that was denied to the outsider!

This… *can't* be a viable way to make history. Because, what notable figures from *our* past require the same cognitive dissonance of *us*? I can only think of the Ku Klux Klan and their ilk— America's original underdogs, who fought to suppress America's [original outsiders](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9648466-you-ve-got-to-be-twice-as-good-to-get-half)! Which doesn't bode well for indie rock's legacy… or poptimism's future…

Yet underdog movements will never go away, because to be treated as an underdog is a *privilege*… and the privileged will always find ways to benefit themselves. But what if you just *aren't* whom the people want to root for? Then let BYCombo throw you a lifeline— by bringing back the rockism of [Sister Rosetta](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/12348736-oh-these-kids-and-rock-and-roll-this-is)!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Fair practices follow the numbers

Perhaps my arguments against indie rock seem misplaced. After all, aren't the tech platforms to blame? Well, sure. But who put them in power? It was the *indie camp*. And for good reason: Every new technology in the '00s— digital downloads, streaming media, crowdfunding— was ultimately about bringing indie rock's good intentions to the Internet!

In the past, a major label would bet on visions that other labels *didn't* see— like, let's say, a regional style erupting into a global revolution. But this left bands powerless to negotiate; they couldn't play one label off another, and a vision by itself is worth nothing. As a result, they often had to accept unfair terms— leading many to [resent the majors](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-music) as "bad guys."

By contrast, the indie labels simply pick what the people want, going by the size of an artist's fanbase. Once *anyone* sees a safe bet, then, *everyone* does… and now all that's left is for one label to outbid the rest by offering the most generous terms. In other words, the way to do *right* by artists— and thus to be rated as a "good guy"— is to trust the numbers!

So when the tech platforms arrived to turn *all* the arts into one big "numbers game," the indie camp went all in. I still recall how they rushed to defend file sharing: "*Real* artists earn a living by going on tour. Recordings are just for publicity; they *should* be free." And social networks: "*Real* artists engage with their fans after a show— and now they can at *any* time."

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review today.
`}

To sum up, it was the *indie camp* who gave us today's [data-driven industry](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/17/steve-albini-at-face-the-music-how-the-internet-solved-problem-with-music)! Thanks to them— and their grievances— even the *majors* now behave like the indies, by forcing you to empower yourself using online tools. The only way to revolt, then, is to reject indie rock *itself*. This is why BYCombo tells you *not* to boost your numbers— but to pursue a vision that few others see.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Unenlightened romanticism is a dark age

Are we headed for a new Romanticism? Some speak of a [rebellion brewing](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/28/new-romanticism-technology-backlash) against science, as algorithms take over the arts. And yet, algorithms simply reflect what the people want, just as word of mouth does… which is why indie rock defended them for as long as it did. In this light, maybe we *shouldn't* be upset with the algorithms, but rather with *ourselves*— the people!

As stated earlier, we humans dislike creative ideas… but we're *also* biased against the underclass who generates them! And when in doubt, we imitate others… yet they *share* our status-based prejudices! So the research is clear: Creative ideas *must* be spread from the top down, by the elites— who alone feel a "noblesse oblige" to help those being *hurt* by our human nature.

Yet indie rock told us to do *away* with elitism: "Any good idea is *sure* to spread from the bottom up… by *us*." In other words, we've been living as romantics— while scoffing at science— all along! In fact, this is why it was so *easy* for the algorithms to take over: The tech platforms just had to speak of "freeing the human spirit" or "obeying the people's will," and we fell for it every time.

So yes, the arts have declined— but it *isn't* because the tech platforms listen to science; it's because the indie camp *doesn't*! The only way forward, then, is a new *Enlightenment*, by which we finally work with our human nature as the research says it is, not as we wish it to be— for the first time this century. And if you join BYCombo… you can help to usher it in.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Startups offer lessons in scalability

In indie rock, a fanbase is built from the bottom up, one fan at a time. So I was often asked, "How do you expect *Yearling's Bobtail* to gain a *million* fans, when no one wants to be its *first*?" "Well, it's my *Ulysses*," I'd reply. "Surely an unknown James Joyce would've faced the same dilemma?" I just didn't have a better answer… until my years as a coder exposed me to startup culture.

Within the past few decades, we've come to learn that startups are uniquely positioned to innovate because of [how they grow](https://paulgraham.com/growth.html#:~:text=That%20difference%20is,from%20the%20beginning.): Unlike a retail store, which can't scale into a chain if it's unprofitable, a startup with few users might lose money on each user— yet *still* hope to turn a profit upon gaining millions of them! How? Through network effects and economies of scale.

Well, this *also* explains how an artist like me— who can't even gain *one* fan— might still hope to gain a *million*! When your lyrics are [hopelessly dense](https://yearlingsbobtail.com/2-willy-the-cocoa/?verse=1&annotation=4), a listener will parse them only if others have done the same: network effects! And when your parts are [hopelessly complex](https://yearlingsbobtail.com/2-willy-the-cocoa/?verse=33&annotation=40), new bandmates won't commit to fully learning them until an audience is guaranteed: economies of scale!

Now here's another point: Having scaled by opening one store at a time, a retail chain *can't* pivot to behaving like a startup. What if, having gained one fan at a time, an indie artist can't pivot to making dense and complex works? What if such works— if they're to be made at all— can *only* be made by those whose dream all *along* was to gain a million fans at *once*, from the top down?

If so, this explains why those in tech now dominate the arts: While investors *readily* fund startups that lose money, the indie tastemakers *refuse* to believe in artists with no fanbase! But now, BYCombo puts you in a unique position to innovate, by letting you dream that millions would gladly be your *millionth* fan— even as none want to be your *first*.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Strivers don't know they're not dreamers

Whenever I used to grumble about getting rejected by the indie tastemakers, friends would ask, "So why don't you *seriously* hustle?" Fair point! Why *didn't* I? I suspect it's because, for Xennials like myself, being an artist was a vision to *dream* about. Once indie rock took over, however, it became a goal to *strive* for. And as a dreamer… I didn't know I wasn't a striver.

See, us dreamers, we're not grounded in reality— which makes our visions hard to fulfill. Naturally, then, it was assumed that we'd gain the most from indie rock's promise of self-empowerment. But… I wasn't prepared for what would follow; I didn't realize a new generation of strivers was about to raise the bar for hustling. So, like a child, I thought I'd get points just for trying.

Yet it's *because* the dreamer is unrealistic that their vision, if ever fulfilled, might change the world in ways a striver's goal never can. And this is what *Millennials* don't realize— being strivers themselves. Which is why they *also* fail to see how past generations of dreamers raised the bar for innovation… such that, now, they think they'll get points just for trying!

But all is assumed to be well, since today's artists easily look and sound like the innovators of yesteryear… while we're never shown what *true* innovation in our times would entail. Still, what if *you're* here to truly innovate— and not just to "larp," or role-play, the *idea* of doing so? Then keep on dreaming, like a child, and let BYCombo help you find the perfect partner: a striver!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Scarcity teaches generational courage

Combining glam's gender-bending look with metal's aggression, glam metal was the ideal youth movement— for a *previous* generation. But as for Gen X… they saw it as a relic. Well, guess what was no less outdated by the '00s: indie rock's rule for artists to hustle! And yet, Millennials embraced it as their own. Why were they content to merely "larp" the next revolution?

Here's what I mean: If you *don't* hustle, the indie camp will reject you. But you should *want* to double down on making art instead— plus, the punishment for breaking this rule means that history will see your act as courageous. So it's one way *not* to larp… *and* a twofer! Who *wouldn't* jump on it? *I* did— and as an Xennial, what did *I* know of courage? Yet no Millennials joined me… Why?

Here's my theory: Millennials faced content scarcity just long enough to hate it. Then, before they could learn to daydream, they were given structured ways to create and consume endless content, which [won their gratitude](https://xkcd.com/1601). And so they never saw what was obvious: The only rules left that take courage to break… are the *structural* ones, like indie rock's— that *they* help to enforce!

Moreover, back when content was scarce, joining a scene— goth, punk— took dedication; it meant rejecting the rest. This taught Gen X to stand fiercely for their side— knowing that others [aren't so different](https://web.archive.org/web/2012/http://www.mitchclem.com/nothingnice/196). Now for Millennials, it's the other way around: Taking a side is *just* a larp— while those who defy the structures that allow for such larping are to be *genuinely* opposed.

So Millennials simply broke the rules that Gen X *already* broke… and called *that* their revolution! Luckily, Gen Z has only ever faced an *over*-abundance of content, and now they [long for a return](http://archive.today/2022.12.15/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/15/style/teens-social-media.html) to its scarcity. Just in time… to try this Xennial's solution! With BYCombo, you can show courage once again— by doubling down to make art, for a serious chunk of lifetime.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Music recording is its own medium

In a world now awash in content, the new Romantics long for a return to live shows. Yet shows are fleeting by nature… just like content! It's why the best live performers, just like content creators, work hard to *consistently* deliver; theirs is the ultimate "workhorse art." And that's great! But who'll deliver this generation's "windfall art"— which calls for betting it all on a *single* chance?

To make *Pet Sounds*, Brian Wilson pushed the studio to its limits, never once considering how the album now seen as his masterpiece might be recreated live. As home studios grew affordable in the '00s, then, I foresaw a revival in which hundreds of unknown artists would take the art of music recording to new heights, each by making a [stellar demo](https://yearlingsbobtail.com/6-ash-wednesday/?annotation=17)— and so I [set to work](https://yearlingsbobtail.com/16-cremated/?annotation=4) on mine.

Upon completion five years later, *Yearling's Bobtail* caught the attention of a few indie labels. Success! I put together a band, and we played a show for one of them. It was… admittedly sloppy, given that my new bandmates still hadn't fully learned their parts. The label founder left in a huff and stopped replying to my emails, later sneering at "headphone albums" on his blog.

Thus I learned indie rock's founding belief: "Live shows tell the truth." Yet if recordings capture what shows can't… then this is an *asset*, not a *liability*! They're two distinct mediums— like cinema versus theatre. So ignore those who insist that "real" artists start out by playing shows. With BYCombo, you can make a stellar demo… with no thought for how you'll recreate it live.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Modern collaboration requires assembly

Demos allow artists to pursue visions they *can't* fulfill on their own, and one vision much in need of a partner's help today is… forming a rock band at all! Because, who'd want to be *anyone's* bandmate, let alone *yours*— given all the perks of being a lone content creator, in a world that now favors pop? Some ask why bands have [largely disappeared](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-bands-are-never-coming-back), but it's really no mystery.

Here's my point: Suppose an indie label were willing to sign me *before* my band was formed. With the assurance of being signed, I could then convince the most dedicated musicians to join me. Clearly, this wouldn't just benefit *me*, but also the *label*, right? And by rethinking how bands might form, we'd see a resurgence of them! Yet the indies can't rethink *anything*…

Luckily, having struggled for half my life to attract bandmates, I anticipated that the best artists would gradually prefer to be *assembled* into bands— and that this, in turn, could open up a new frontier to explore! So relax, and put all your effort into simply *deserving* the most dedicated bandmates… safe in the knowledge that BYCombo will then help you find them.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Advances are made in aesthetics, not logistics

When is it a "larp"? Here's a test: Could it have been a fictional movie *instead*? Let's say, a fictional Queen… How would you commission the soundtrack?! So, Queen: no larp. "Well then, isn't it *also* no larp for an indie artist to hustle, if they're using an app that changed the paradigm too *soon* to make sense in a movie?" Okay, fair enough. But in that case, isn't the *real* hero… the app?

In music history courses, we learn that the evolution of the piano allowed Beethoven to compose sonatas of unprecedented [range and dynamics](https://www.cpr.org/2020/09/19/he-wanted-larger-and-louder-the-pianos-of-beethovens-time-werent-enough-for-him). By contrast, it's hardly mentioned that the invention of lithography allowed his scores to be sold to the middle class. In other words, music historians take note of technology when it advances the *art form*— not the *supply chain*.

Unlike what the indie camp believes, then, music history *won't* care how the Internet empowered artists to hustle. But what if they were assembled into bands, allowing them to combine mediums in unprecedented ways? At long last, they'd be the *real* heroes! So come join BYCombo, and explore *another* frontier— by having a dancer, illustrator, or puppeteer as your bandmate.

### ${++sectionCounter}. A renaissance of elders awaits

Beethoven composed his [magnum opus](https://youtu.be/4IqnVCc-Yqo) in the final years of his life— and he was no exception: The best composers got *better* with age. But this still isn't the case with rock bands— which means there's yet *another* frontier left to explore! So if you're a Millennial, don't fret: You still have a lifetime to give *future* generations the renaissance that indie rock denied to *yours*.

In her book [*Generations*](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Generations/Jean-M-Twenge/9781982181611), Jean Twenge notes that young folks are reaching key milestones *later* in life, because society in *general* is now more complex; thus more time is needed to fulfill your potential. But this must also be true for the arts in *particular*— which explains how Millennials got off track there: Indie rock taught them to hustle… and hustling makes you burn out *sooner*.

By contrast, a deep love of the craft can motivate you for a lifetime. After all, to take on greater challenges, you must build your talents further— and to build your talents further, you must take on greater challenges… onward and upward, in a virtuous circle. So if you're burned out by the hustle, BYCombo can get you back on track— by helping you stay in love with your craft.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Happiness flows from the act of creation

At the peak of my years working eighty-hour weeks— forty to earn a living, and forty on my own projects— a friend staged an intervention. "On a scale of one to ten," he asked, "how happy are you?" "Eight," I replied. He was floored; he'd expected a three. And so I cleared up the matter: The very reason I chose this unusual path was to *guarantee* my happiness.

In his book [*Flow*](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/flow-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi), Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi points out that when you have a clear goal; feel adequately challenged; and get immediate feedback from the task at hand, you become fully immersed in the act of creation— which leads to long-term fulfillment. This explains how my years of sacrifice were some of my happiest; I *wasn't* slowly killing myself, as my friend had feared.

Meanwhile, there's a [mental health crisis](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/music-and-mental-health) in music today, with artists facing high levels of anxiety and depression. Why is this? It's because any exposure gained from years of hustling might just as well be won by chance, or bought through privilege, in an instant. Every indie artist knows this, yet they play the losing game anyway… and it eats at their soul.

Yes, the struggle can be a gift— but only when you face it on your own terms. If you're forced to use the same tools as everyone else… then it's a *grind*. This is why BYCombo tells you to focus on your craft, and to join a community of peers who'll do the same. It isn't *just* to make your art better; it's *also* for your happiness— and the good of your soul.

### ${++sectionCounter}. Solutions come from systems thinking

Why is progressivism so badly beaten in both culture and politics today? It's because indie rock told us all to take down the "system" and its elites— but this only works out for libertarians, who aren't looking to replace the system with any other; decentralization is their end goal. We progressives, however, *depend* on centralized institutions to promote the welfare we want.

So the anti-elitists among us topple the system by joining with libertarians… who then resist their efforts to build a new one… which must now be morally perfect to survive. But— surprise!— these new builders will then prove to be no less flawed than those they replaced. Which means they'll get taken down as well… in an endless test of [moral purity](https://youtu.be/qaHLd8de6nM) that no one can pass.

But there's good news: With some supporters of anti-elitist progressivism now having swung to the political *right*, it's no longer far-fetched to claim that anti-elitism *itself*— irrespective of politics— is a stance of the *cultural* right. It's the *right* that's best served by toppling the system; the *left* is better off building it back from within!

Which means we progressives will need to quit "larping" the revolution, and [learn to build](https://jasonpargin.substack.com/p/is-modern-mass-media-a-mind-prison#:~:text=The%20reality%20is,to%20peacefully%20cooperate.) instead— beginning with the very skills needed to analyze our problems and propose solutions. But how? Beyond just knowing our human nature… we must also appreciate systems in all their complexity.

So if I could get every progressive— in both culture and politics— to read just one book, it would be [*Thinking in Systems*](https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/thinking-in-systems) by Donella Meadows, who shows us how to understand systems in terms of their connections and feedback loops. It's what led to many of the insights that shaped BYCombo's mission— and hopefully, it can lead to some of your own!

### ${++sectionCounter}. The simplest explanation is likely correct

To explain the squiggles traversed by the planets in their orbits around the Earth, ancient astronomers mapped out a convoluted model of epicycles. But then Copernicus proposed that the planets actually revolve around the *Sun*, turning these squiggles into circles. This was a [simpler explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)— so over time, it became accepted as the correct one.

Well, music today requires a pretty convoluted explanation, doesn't it? After all, the indie way is generally understood to deliver the boldest art… yet *no* indie artist can rival what the major labels gave us in the '90s?! And now the majors *themselves* [behave like](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/nine-predictions-for-the-future-of#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20why%20record,as%20indie%20operators.) indie labels, by only signing artists who *don't* need a label… yet this *hasn't* led to the next Nirvana or Radiohead?!

So let's ditch old assumptions, and think in systems: "Indiefication" leads to a "prisoner's dilemma," right? Once an artist redirects 5% of their effort toward *getting* the job— rather than simply *deserving* it— all others will be forced to do the same. But this creates a "race to the bottom," since someone else can now redirect *10%* of their effort… then *15%*… *20%*…

With this being the case, shouldn't we expect indiefication to make music… *worse*? Whoa— everything lines up now! Yet the indie camp will oppose this simpler explanation— so BYCombo won't get far by merely proposing it. To gain acceptance, interdependence still needs advocates. Will you join with the Bobtail Yearlings, then, and be a Galileo of music?

### ${++sectionCounter}. Art needs the passion of martyrs

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review move of this and next section.
`}

"Where's *our* Nirvana?" It's a question asked by today's young folks. Well, there's an easy way to answer it: Can we imagine the *next* generation asking of any band today, "Where's *our* _____?" If so, then _____ is this generation's Nirvana. Of course, we can't— because this generation never got their own Nirvana. But… why *didn't* they?

It's because we only pine for past artists who self-sacrificed to advance the art form— and future audiences will feel the same. But indie rock *protects* artists from exploitation, and so it roots for those who *empower* themselves instead. As a result, today's indie artists demand fair compensation; they don't do *anything* that reeks of being exploited— *especially* self-sacrifice.

Yet self-empowerment comes with its own set of problems. For one, it's just [power-seeking](http://archive.today/2022.10.26/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/arts/music/ryan-adams-women-sex.html), [self-serving](https://pitchfork.com/news/arcade-fires-win-butler-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-by-multiple-women-frontman-responds) behavior in those we see as underdogs; it's not noble in and of itself. For another, artists with this trait hold the *advantage*— so how are *they* the underdogs? But worst of all, it ensures that indie rock's structural rules, which promise fair compensation, can *never* be broken.

If rock is to be saved, then, we *must* give amnesty to those who self-sacrifice for art's sake. Yes, by needing business partners, they leave themselves open to exploitation— and by siding with elitist gatekeepers, they incur the wrath of *middling* artists. But once the art form declines, what's left to protect? So after Empowerment… comes the Age of Martyrdom.

Let's never go back to the days of artists dying young, of course. Thankfully, history tells of another kind of martyr: those who sacrificed not their *lives*, but their *lifetimes*. What if the next Nirvana is an entire *movement* of selfless bands, each one sacrificing a serious chunk of lifetime? If so, then come join BYCombo— and help give the next generation a Nirvana of their own!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Artists want faith in saviors

Let's return to the original question: How has indie rock made music worse? In summary, past artists grew up believing that, once they were ready, they could partner with elites who'd advocate for them by spreading their works from the top down. And thus secure in this faith, they built up the talents that gave us "[Reason to Believe](https://youtu.be/dUWZw8uDak4)"… and "[Both Sides, Now](https://youtu.be/J48BpiPLHtA?t=1989)"… and "[Superstar](https://youtu.be/SJmmaIGiGBg)"…

Thanks to indie rock, however, today's artists have no such reason to believe. So they put out work after work, hoping one will catch on with the crowd— which, these days, means going viral. But by spreading their works from the bottom up, they build a different set of talents, leading to a different kind of work— a difference that many of us hear, even if we can't articulate it.

"Is it *worse*, though?" Yes, insofar as it won't *last*. Remember, historians are *elites*; they don't *need* to obey the people's will. If they *want* to advocate for Joni Mitchell, now, it's because she made it easy for potential partners back then to feel the same. But when artists are being discovered by the crowd… well, who wouldn't just leave them to be *re*-discovered this way as well?

Today's music is worse, then, because it's bottom up— while history *itself* is top down. Sadly, much like fish don't know they're wet, Millennials and Gen Z don't know these are bottom-up times. Which means the revolution *must* be started by us Xennials, who recall a top-down past. So come join BYCombo, and build up your talents… in faith that a savior will then find you!

### ${++sectionCounter}. Victory is assured

Once indie rock's ideals take root, they end up taking over. After all, with so many artists to choose from, what label *wouldn't* prefer the one who can do the middleman's job? Or what critic, the one whose well-presented identity provides so much surrounding context? Or what fan, the one who directly engages with them— while [milking them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Franklin_effect) for free labor?

Meanwhile, since interdependent bands refuse to hustle, they can't compete on *any* of those terms! All they can do is promise to make better art— but by itself, this convinces no one. Because, how *much* better are we talking about? Fortunately, we can turn to the Pareto principle, which states that 20% of the effort yields 80% of the results.

Now, since indie artists do it all themselves, they must put in a further 80% effort to get that last 20% in results, right? So, 100% results for 100% effort. Interdependent bands, however, play to their strengths by having *partners* cover their weaknesses— which lets them put 20% effort into getting 80% results, over and over. Well, added up… that's *400%* results!

Let's call this the "4x law of interdependence," then: By allowing a band to benefit from division of labor— and thus to form a whole greater than the sum of its parts— we can expect them to be *four* times better. Which checks out: The greatest interdependent band *ever* is the Beatles, who are *certainly* four times better than anything indie rock has to offer!

So now, what potential partner *wouldn't* prefer a BYCombo band such as yours, if you can promise to be *four* times better? In the long run, then, our victory is *assured*! Or to borrow an old [Soviet joke](http://archive.today/2025.03.07/https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/22/world/in-hope-and-dismay-lenin-s-heirs-speak.html#:~:text=In%20the%20Communist,capitalism%20to%20capitalism.''): "Indie rock is the longest and most painful route from interdependence… to interdependence."
