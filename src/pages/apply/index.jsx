# Join the interdependence revolution!

Are you ready to sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime to make rock history? Be part of BYCombo's pilot cohort!

### Diversity policy

**Women and minorities are encouraged to apply!**

As a rock movement *founded* by a minority, BYCombo was *conceived* to give disadvantaged groups the interdependence they naturally prefer and thrive under.

### Who we're looking for

Perhaps you're one of the following:

* A rock musician: singer, guitarist, drummer…
* A musician of any other stripe: cellist, tabla player…
* An artist of another medium: animator, web developer…
* An administrator: manager, social media guru…

We'll set you up with a few prospective bandmates. You'll review each other's links and videos, then meet online. If everyone agrees to form a band, you'll relocate to Los Angeles or another major city. After you've settled in, each of you will put in enough time on your band project for the sum total to be at least 25,000 hours.

There are no legal contracts or fees. We'll just ask you to make a nonbinding pledge to be vaccinated, to respect pronouns, and so forth.

### What we'll do for you

BYCombo will include you in a supportive community of other ambitious bands. Through the years, we'll advise you on your band project. The Bobtail Yearlings will also help where they can!

Once your demo is complete, we'll add it to our public registry and then notify the music fans and industry insiders on our mailing list. With your help, BYCombo will become the public's trusted resource to hear about the latest bands sacrificing serious chunks of lifetime to advance the art form!

### How to apply

Email us the following information, and we'll be in touch:

* Your name, email address, and pronouns
* Your city, and where you can relocate, if not Los Angeles
* Your musical and aesthetic preferences— or dealbreakers
* Your artistic talents and corresponding skill levels
* Your bold ideas for a musical project, if any
* Links to social media or video demonstrations

If you're co-applying with one or more bandmates, please send a single email with each person's information. If you have special circumstances that need to be considered, please let us know! We'll try to make things work.
