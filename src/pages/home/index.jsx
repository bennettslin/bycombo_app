# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of self-sacrificing rock bands. We're here to launch the interdependence revolution, a movement devoted to bringing forth this century's most historically consequential rock music!**

Of course, *indie*-pendence is the dominant ideology in rock today. So why is *inter*-dependence needed as an alternative?

Hi, I'm Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com/essays/ongoing/band-mission-and-principles)! Let me explain…

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock roots for the underdog, which is why it's all about lowering the barriers to entry. To do this, it provides artists with tools to bypass the labels and build a fanbase on their own: social media analytics, streaming platform algorithms, and the like.

Here's the problem: These tools only offer an advantage over other artists who *don't* use them— but today, most *do*. So there's no longer any benefit; from here on out, their sole purpose is to punish any holdouts. Except… this is how *rules* work! By encouraging artists to use these tools, indie rock has now made it the *rule* to do so!

And these tools *aren't* free; they cost time and energy that could be spent making art instead. So if you're a band hoping to make the *best* art, you *won't* bother with them— leaving you *worse* off in this new Age of Empowerment! Yet from what I've seen, almost no one else sympathizes. Well, okay then… how about a truce?

***Yes*— since rules are made to be followed, bands who refuse to use indie rock's tools can't complain about being punished. *But*— breaking the rules is how rock history gets made! So let's not shut them out either.**

### The outsider's dilemma

Here's the curious part: Ever notice that the best rappers *don't* worry about empowerment? It comes to them for free, if they just build up their talents. For example, Eminem *didn't* have a real fanbase before he was discovered by Dr. Dre; his self-released EP sold [all of 250 copies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slim_Shady_EP). Why does hip hop work so differently from indie rock?

It's simple: While indie rock was founded by *underdogs*, hip hop was founded by *outsiders*. What's the difference? The public doesn't root for outsiders. So as a minority myself, I'm drawn to hip hop's way of thinking. I want my band to be *inter*-dependent: to have a *label* build our fanbase— and, in turn, have this label depend on *us* to make the best art.

By *not* using indie rock's tools, however, I'm seen as a hobbyist— and then my band isn't charitably supported as an indie artist would be. But charitable support is such a winning advantage, no other artist can hope to compete. Which means the *labels* can only compete by signing indie artists— who work hard *not* to need them. What a mess! And yet the future is clear:

**As indie artists grow further empowered, labels will soon have no reason to exist— *unless* they get back to signing interdependent bands, who *do* need them… as it's the only way to make better art!**

### Return of the rock martyrs

And that's the funny part: Rock *was* interdependent once! Well then, can't a band simply promise to make the best art, as before? Sadly, no. In a world of charitable support, *all* art is now subjective; talent predicts nothing. This means an indie label's *only* trusted measure is the objective size of an artist's fanbase. Good grief… Can rock be saved?

Yes! See, indie rock has a glaring weakness. It doesn't *actually* separate the best artists from the worst; it picks "serious" artists over "casual" ones, in the faith that this amounts to the same thing. My solution, then, is to show that indie rock's rules, taken to their logical extreme, will force us to dismiss *all* the best artists as hobbyists! Here's how it works:

**To save rock, self-sacrificing bands must spend *all* their time and energy— for untold *years* of their lifetime— on a demo that *objectively* advances the art form, and which couldn't have been made for *any* less effort.**

But who'd volunteer to be the first of these new martyrs? A hungry outsider, that's who! Which is why I spent 25,000 hours— *twelve* full-time years!— on [*Yearling's Bobtail*](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com). And, of course, it was by *not* building a fanbase that I was free to code and illustrate the audio webcomic. Because surely even the indie labels love it when a creative work *needs* to break the rules!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

Well… not so fast. As barriers to entry are lowered, the applicant pool gets flooded, overwhelming the indie labels and other gatekeepers. This makes them insist all the more firmly that artists use indie rock's tools, which serve to keep every work bite-sized and uniform. And so they largely ignored my demo, as it wasn't in a format they expected.

It's worse than just that, however. Sheer talent and creative invention may be the outsider's strengths, but they're the underdog's weaknesses. So by reflex, indie rock *rejects* them. This is why it prizes works admired by critics, who root for underdogs— but *not* those [envied by musicians](https://www.bycombo.com/indie#history-happens-by-peer-review), who don't; and why it disputes the studies that say we're all biased [*against* creativity](https://www.bycombo.com/indie#creativity-gets-its-chance-from-the-clueless).

The indie gatekeepers also ignored my later projects that would have *helped* their artists: [*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com), my songwriting book, and [*Bobtail Dominoes*](https://www.bobtaildominoes.com), my musical tile game. So even *altruism* is a losing strategy for the outsider, since underdogs are *loved* for only [helping themselves](https://www.bycombo.com/indie#art-needs-the-blood-of-martyrs)! And this is how I learned the hard way:

**A movement that's kind to the underdog *must* be cruel to the outsider. In other words, indie rock *isn't* simply waiting for hungry outsiders to show up offering better art. It's actively shutting them out!**

Worst of all, if the major labels are "bad guys," then the indie labels are "good guys." Well, who finally put the good guys in charge? Millennials! It's their greatest achievement, which they now protect at all costs. So anyone who questions their gatekeepers— especially anyone from an older generation— is a [bad guy as well](https://youtu.be/tODG4Xt45bU)! Here, then, is the heart of the problem:

**As the first rock movement to believe its ideals to be universal, indie rock is also the first to lock down its rules for good. As such, there's no historical precedent to show us how to dissent— or even to assure us that we *can*.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

But if we can't dissent… then let's revolt! By some miracle, Gen Z sides with the *older* generations; *they* want to save rock as well! And their discontent is the first step toward reviving interdependence from the *outside*: It tells potential business partners that the rock market is ripe for disruption.

These "Dr. Dres of rock" would love to meet with bands who can promise to make the best art— but how will they find one another, given the endless stream pouring in through indie rock's low barriers to entry? The next step, then, is for an alternative source to willfully *raise* its barriers. And here's where BYCombo comes in!

**Interdependent bands can now earn the listener's trust by paying a steep *cost* of entry: To have their demo shown in BYCombo's registry, each band must sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime to advance the art form.**

Picture a hundred BYCombo bands, all of them breaking indie rock's rules to make the most creative works of our times— only to *still* be dismissed as hobbyists by the indie gatekeepers! They would be this generation's Beatles, Sex Pistols, *and* Shaggs, rolled into one. This, then, is the *final* step toward reviving interdependence— the next revolution in rock history!
