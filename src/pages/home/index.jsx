# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. Our mission is to launch the interdependence revolution, and to support the bands who'll make interdependence the most consequential rock movement of the century!**

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock wants to lower the barriers to entry by providing artists with tools of empowerment. These tools aren't actually free: They cost the artist's time and energy. And yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them. So all they do is penalize those who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! These tools are really just more *rules*. Which tells us:

**Any culture that wants to empower artists will end up imposing a system of rules.**

### Calling for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. I'd rather be *interdependent*, not indie. I *want* to depend on a record label. It's how rock worked in the past, and it's how hip hop still works today. Is it just a coincidence that music got worse once indie rock took over?

// TODO: Connect interdependence and rule breaking${'  '}

So I think indie rock's rules hurt the art form, and I refuse to follow them. Yet if everyone felt this way, then breaking the rules… would be the new rule! So I understand why this attitude sets me back, and why I get no sympathy for it. But at the same time, everyone *else* understands that rule breakers are the ones who make rock history! So how about a truce:

**Since rules are made to be followed, rule breakers can't complain that they face *natural* disadvantages. But since breaking the rules is also how history gets made, let's not *systematically* shut them out either.**

### A thousand *Yearling's Bobtail*s

Here's one disadvantage: Because rule breakers aren't thrilled to put *any* time or energy into using tools of empowerment, they can seem lazy or inept. To counter this misreading, then, their only option is to pour *all* their time and energy into advancing the art form, with an ambitious demo that *couldn't* have been made for any less effort. Yet think of what this means:

// TODO: Consolidate interdependence and rule breaking${'  '}
**Rule breakers won't just be making the *disruptive* works of our time— their works will be this generation's most *accomplished* as well.**

Which is why I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time *years*!— to make the music and webcomic for *Yearling's Bobtail*. And I'm not the only one who'd rather double down on making art. Picture a thousand interdependent bands, each making an ambitious demo of their own. It would be the next revolution!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

And yet… indie rock isn't set up to notice. When barriers to entry are lowered, gatekeepers become harried; and harried gatekeepers have no patience for ambitious demos. Instead, every artist hoping for their consideration *must* follow the rules by using their tools; we'll simply never hear about any who *don't*. And this is the heart of the problem:

**Once the gatekeepers fail us by shutting out the rule breakers, there's no way for us to know. Which means they'll be failing us for a long time— and likely already *have been*.**

// TODO: Bring up in culture${'  '}

### An anti-indie counterculture

// TODO: All of this section${'  '}
The situation might seem hopeless. Luckily, some music fans *also* find indie rock's rules absurd, and would rather break them as well! They know that lowering barriers to entry only raises them elsewhere. And they want to be *awestruck* by artists, not to *support* them. Today's rock just doesn't seem destined to make history, which tells them that something is very wrong.

These disgruntled music fans are rock's last hope. They already have the *will* to challenge the indie gatekeepers. Now with BYCombo, they finally have the *way*.
