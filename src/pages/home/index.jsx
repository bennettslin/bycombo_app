**BYCombo offers hope for amnesty to interdependent-minded artists who advance the art form. Our approach as a nonprofit is to assemble them into rock bands ourselves, and then expose them to potential partners.**

Hi, I'm Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://bobtailyearlings.com)! You might be wondering why an amnesty program is needed in the arts— or why we favor interdependence, when *indie*-pendence is the dominant thinking today. Let me explain…

### Tools… are *rules*

In the past, artists were powerless to get themselves known; they could only hope to be *made* known, by a record label. But now, indie rock provides them with online tools that allow them to hustle and build a fanbase on their own: social media, streaming services, crowdfunding platforms… and so forth.

Except… here's the problem: These tools only offer an advantage over other artists who *don't* use them— and today, most *do*. So there's no longer much benefit; from here on out, their main purpose is to punish any holdouts. But wait… this is how *rules* work! By encouraging artists to use these tools, indie rock has now made it the *rule* to do so!

And these tools *aren't* free; they cost time and energy that could be spent making art instead. So if your band hopes to make the *best* art, you won't bother with them— leaving you *worse* off in this new Age of Empowerment! Yet in my experience, few others sympathize. Well, how about a truce?

**Yes— since rules are made to be followed, bands who refuse to hustle can't complain about remaining unknown. But— breaking the rules is *also* how history gets made! So let's be open to giving amnesty.**

### The outsider's dilemma

Here's the curious part: Ever notice that the best rappers *don't* worry about self-empowerment? It comes to them for free— if they just build up enough talents. For example, Eminem *didn't* have a fanbase when he was discovered by Dr. Dre; his self-released EP sold [all of 250 copies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slim_Shady_EP). Why does hip hop work so differently from indie rock?

It's simple: While indie rock was founded by *underdogs*, hip hop was founded by *outsiders*. What's the difference? The public doesn't root for outsiders. So as a minority myself, I'm drawn to hip hop's *inter*-dependent way of thinking. I'd rather be an "Eminem of rock" and have *partners* advocate for my band— while having these partners, in turn, depend on *us* to make the best art.

By *not* hustling, however, I'm dismissed as a hobbyist— and then my band isn't charitably supported as an indie artist would be. But charitable support is such a [winning advantage](/indie#charitable-support-starts-an-arms-race), no other artist can hope to compete. Which means a *label* can only compete by signing indie artists… who work hard *not* to need them. What a mess! And yet, the future is clear:

**As indie artists grow further empowered, labels will soon have no reason to exist— *unless* they get back to signing interdependent bands, who *do* need them… seeing that it's the only way to make the best art!**

### Return of the rock martyrs

And this is the funny part: Rock *was* interdependent once! Well then, can't a band simply promise to make the best art, as before? Sadly, no. In a world of charitable support, all art is now *subjective*; talent predicts nothing. Which means an indie label's only trusted measure is the *objective* size of an artist's fanbase. Good grief… Can we fix this mess?

Yes! You see, indie rock has a glaring weakness: It doesn't *actually* separate the best artists from the rest; it merely picks the "serious" ones, who hustle, over the "hobbyists," who don't— in the faith that this amounts to the same thing. Well, we can *refute* this assumption! Here's how:

**Interdependent bands must spend *all* their time and energy, for untold *years* of their lifetime, on a demo that *objectively* advances the art form— and which couldn't have been made with *any* less effort.**

The downside is clear… So who'd sign up to be the first of these new rock martyrs? Why, a hungry outsider, that's who! As such, I spent 25,000 hours— or twelve full-time years— making [*Yearling's Bobtail*](https://yearlingsbobtail.com), which includes coding and illustrating the audio webcomic. And of course, it was *only* by breaking indie rock's rules that I could do so. Surely, then, I'd be given amnesty!

### Who makes the tastemakers?

Well… not so fast. The indie camp assumes that every artist faces the same hurdles— in which case, clearing the way for an underdog should still help the rest. Except… your hurdles as an outsider *aren't* the same. To compensate for *not* being the one they're rooting for, you need to try much harder, to be much better. But then… this makes *you* the underdog's biggest hurdle!

So even as you build up *objective* strengths to win over a skeptical public, the indie tastemakers tip the scale toward the underdog by keeping their criteria *subjective*. Which is why they favor music that *lacks* [enviable hooks](/indie#time-is-kind-to-craft-not-context), and why they refuse to acknowledge our human bias *against* [creative invention](/indie#creativity-gets-its-chance-from-the-clueless).

Suffice it to say, then… the indie labels rejected my demo. They also ignored later projects of mine that promised to *help* their underdogs: my songwriting book [*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com), and my musical tile game [*Bobtail Dominoes*](https://bobtaildominoes.com). So even *altruism* is a losing strategy for the outsider! And now I finally understood:

**Indie rock will *never* give amnesty to interdependent bands, because *being* interdependent is what brands them as outsiders— and a movement that's kind to the underdog *must* be cruel to the outsider!**

Worst of all, if the major labels are "bad guys," then this makes the indies "good guys." Well, who finally put the good guys in charge? Millennials! It's their greatest achievement, which they now protect at all costs. So anyone who questions their tastemakers is a bad guy as well— especially anyone from an [older generation](https://youtu.be/tODG4Xt45bU). And this gets at the heart of the problem:

**As the first rock movement to hold its ideals to be universal, indie rock is also the first to lock its rules in place. Which means there's no historical precedent to teach us how to resist— or even to tell us that we *can*.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

If we can't resist, though— let's revolt! How? We… wait. See, indie rock has *another* glaring weakness: In judging artists by the size of their fanbase, its tastemakers end up favoring *content*— namely, art that's optimized to gain fans in the *present*. But content has no *future* chances… and to prove this, we just need time to pass.

Sure enough, the last two decades of rock have had [little impact](https://today.yougov.com/entertainment/articles/36462-best-decade-for-music-americans-poll-data); even Gen Z seems to agree! Which is the first step to winning back our interdependence, since it's only once the *youth* are discontent that budding entrepreneurs will think to disrupt the market; discerning curators will try to save the arts; and future historians will know to teach the mistakes of our past.

These "Dr. Dres of rock" would love to give amnesty to interdependent bands who've broken indie rock's rules… but how? Any such band currently remains unknown for having done so, and with today's low barriers to entry, the field is more crowded than ever. The next step, then, is for [elitist gatekeepers](/indie#elitism-is-the-great-equalizer) like BYCombo to enforce a steep *cost* of entry. Here's the general idea:

**Each BYCombo band will sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime to make a demo that advances the art form, which they'll then show in our demo registry to build a case for partners to grant them amnesty.**

So picture a *hundred* such bands, all of them committed to giving us the historically consequential works of our times. This will be the *final* step to winning back our interdependence— the next revolution in rock history!
