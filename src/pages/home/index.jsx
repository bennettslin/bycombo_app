# "A thousand *Yearling's Bobtail*s"

Hi, I'm Bennett. It took me 25,000 hours— twelve full-time years!— to make *Yearling's Bobtail*. Now imagine a thousand other bands putting the same time and energy into their own demos. It would be the next revolution!

And yet, indie rock isn't set up to notice such efforts. The labels are too busy to learn who's out there, so artists need to vie for attention by wasting time and energy on broken signals, like touring at a loss.

But BYCombo fixes this mess! We promise the labels that each band spends a solid chunk of lifetime on their demo; and we promise the bands that each label gives their demo fair consideration. So labels can know who's out there, and bands can focus on what matters. And the interdependence revolution can begin!

### Who we're looking for

BYCombo is open to anyone who wants to join a band and make history! You're also one of the following:

* A creator with bold ideas for a musical project
* A rock musician— singer, guitarist, drummer
* A musician of another stripe— throatsinger, tabla player
* An artist of some other medium— dancer, web developer

You'll relocate with your band to Los Angeles or another major US city. Once settled, you'll commit forty hours a week for three years— around 6,000 hours total— to the making of an ambitious demo. Then when the demo is complete, you'll perform all the expected duties of a band member.

### What we'll do for you

BYCombo will put you in a band with three or four like-minded artists of comparable talent, subject to everyone's approval. Through the years, we'll advise you and provide you with a supportive community of other bands. The Bobtail Yearlings will also help wherever they can!

Once your demo is completed, we'll send it to participating labels. We'll then post it on this website, where it will be discoverable to anyone looking for an ambitious band with a 25,000-hour demo.
