# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of self-sacrificing rock bands. We're here to lead the interdependence revolution, a movement devoted to bringing forth this century's most historically consequential rock music!**

Of course, *indie*-pendence is the dominant ideology in rock today. So why is *inter*-dependence needed as an alternative?

Hi, I'm Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com)! Let me explain…

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock roots for the underdog, and so its mission is to lower the barriers to entry for artists. As such, it provides them with tools of empowerment— social media analytics, streaming platform algorithms, and so forth— that allow them to bypass the labels and build a fanbase on their own.

Except… here's the problem: These tools only offer an advantage over other artists who *don't* use them— and today, most *do*. So there's no longer much benefit; from here on out, their main purpose is to punish any holdouts. But… this is how *rules* work! By encouraging artists to use these tools, indie rock has now made it the *rule* to do so!

And these tools *aren't* free; they cost time and energy that could be spent making art instead. So if you're a band trying to make the *best* art, you won't bother with them— leaving you *worse* off in this new Age of Empowerment! Yet from what I've seen, few others sympathize. Well, okay… then how about a truce?

***Yes*— since rules are made to be followed, bands who refuse to use indie rock's tools can't complain about being punished. *But*— breaking the rules is how rock history gets made! So let's not shut them out either.**

### The outsider's dilemma

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Put "Eminem of rock" here?
`}

Here's the curious part: Ever notice that the best rappers *don't* worry about empowerment? It comes to them for free, if they just build up their talents. For example, Eminem *didn't* have a real fanbase before he was discovered by Dr. Dre; his self-released EP sold [all of 250 copies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slim_Shady_EP). Why does hip hop work so differently from indie rock?

It's simple: While indie rock was founded by *underdogs*, hip hop was founded by *outsiders*. What's the difference? The public doesn't root for outsiders. So as a minority myself, I'm drawn to hip hop's way of thinking. I want my band to be *inter*-dependent: to have a *label* build our fanbase— and, in turn, have this label depend on *us* to make the best art.

By *not* using indie rock's tools, however, I'm seen as a hobbyist— and then my band isn't charitably supported as an indie artist would be. But charitable support is such a winning advantage, no other artist can hope to compete. Which means the *labels* can only compete by signing indie artists— who work hard *not* to need them. What a mess! And yet the future is clear:

**As indie artists grow further empowered, labels will soon have no reason to exist— *unless* they get back to signing interdependent bands, who *do* need them… as it's the only way to make better art!**

### Return of the rock martyrs

And that's the funny part: Rock *was* interdependent once! Well then, can't a band simply promise to make the best art, as before? Sadly, no. In a world of charitable support, *all* art is now subjective; talent predicts nothing. This means an indie label's *only* trusted measure is the objective size of an artist's fanbase. Good grief… Can this mess be fixed?

Yes! See, indie rock has a glaring weakness. It doesn't *actually* separate the best artists from the worst; it picks "serious" artists over "casual" ones, in the faith that this amounts to the same thing. My solution, then, is to show that indie rock's rules, taken to their logical extreme, will *force* us to dismiss all our best artists as hobbyists! Here's how it works:

**To revive interdependence, bands must spend *all* their time and energy— for untold *years* of their lifetime— on a demo that *objectively* advances the art form, and that couldn't have been made for *any* less effort.**

But who'd volunteer to be the first of these new martyrs? A hungry outsider, that's who! Which is why I spent 25,000 hours— *twelve* full-time years!— on [*Yearling's Bobtail*](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com). And, of course, it was by *not* building a fanbase that I was free to code and illustrate the audio webcomic. Because surely even the indie labels love it when a creative work *needs* to break the rules!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Keep working on underdogs vs. outsiders. Then review this entire section.

Work on third paragraph. So if the gatekeepers simply *refuse* to be interdependent, then the underdog wins by default. And it isn't humanly possible to work harder, to be better— without depending on others.

Continue instinct.
`}

Well… not so fast. Indie rock's basic assumption is that every artist struggles in the same way. So if you just remove hurdles for the ones you want, you'll still clear a path for the rest. But… the outsider's struggles *aren't* the same. To compensate for *not* being the one you want, they have to work much harder, to be much better— making *them* the underdog's biggest hurdle!

By instinct, then, indie rock ends up devaluing the kind of objective talents that an "Eminem of rock" would try to build up. This explains why it favors music that *lacks* [well-crafted hooks](/indie#timeless-music-has-intrinsic-appeal), for example, and why its gatekeepers have never examined their own human bias *against* [creative invention](/indie#creativity-gets-its-chance-from-the-clueless).

Meanwhile, the outsider has one weakness: They *need* to be interdependent. It just isn't humanly possible to work harder, to be better, without it. In other words, indie rock *doesn't* fail to understand how its rules limit the art form. 

! And thus I learned the hard way:

**A movement that's kind to the underdog *must* be cruel to the outsider. So indie rock *isn't* simply waiting for outsiders to show up with better art. It's actively shutting them out!**

Worst of all, if the major labels are "bad guys," then the indie labels are "good guys." Well, who finally put the good guys in charge? Millennials! It's their greatest achievement, which they now protect at all costs. So anyone who questions their gatekeepers— especially anyone from an older generation— is a [bad guy as well](https://youtu.be/tODG4Xt45bU)! And this gets at the heart of the problem:

**As the first rock movement to believe its ideals to be universal, indie rock is also the first to lock down its rules for good. As such, there's no historical precedent to show us how to resist— or even to assure us that we *can*.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review this section a few times.

Is tense in this paragraph correct?
`}

But if we can't resist, then let's revolt! How? By… waiting. See, indie rock has another glaring weakness: No *future* generation is going to root for a *past* underdog. After all, what difficulties did this "underdog" face in hindsight, having been charitably supported in their own time? Indie rock just wasn't designed to age well— and so it won't.

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Replace budding entrepreneurs once partners page is done.
`}

Sure enough, today Gen Zers see what the *older* generations see: Indie rock is their hair metal— making the *next* revolution their grunge! And this is the first step to reviving interdependence from the outside, because it's only once the *youth* are discontent that budding entrepreneurs will try to disrupt the rock market.

These "Dr. Dres of rock" would love to discover bands who can promise to make the best art— but how will they find one another, given the sheer number of artists coming in through indie rock's low barriers to entry? The next step, then, is for an alternative source to willfully *raise* its barriers. And here's where BYCombo comes in!

**Interdependent bands can now earn the listener's trust by paying a steep *cost* of entry: To have their demo shown in BYCombo's registry, each band must sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime to advance the art form.**

Picture a hundred BYCombo bands, all of them breaking indie rock's rules to make the most creative works of our times— only to *still* be dismissed as hobbyists by the indie gatekeepers! They would be this generation's Beatles, Sex Pistols, *and* Shaggs, rolled into one. This, then, is the *final* step to reviving interdependence— the next revolution in rock history!
