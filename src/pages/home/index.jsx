# The BYCombo mission

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Add link for "Five vowels" to "historically consequential," both here and on the About page.
`}

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of self-sacrificing rock bands. We're here to launch the interdependence revolution, a movement devoted to bringing forth this century's most historically consequential rock music!**

Of course, *indie*-pendence is the dominant ideology in rock today. So why is *inter*-dependence needed as an alternative? Here's why…

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock loves to help the underdog, which is why it's all about lowering the barriers to entry for artists. To do this, it provides them with tools to build a fanbase on their own: distribution services, streaming algorithms, social media analytics, and so forth.

These tools of empowerment aren't free, though— they cost the artist's time and energy. And yet, since they're available to *every* artist, they don't give any meaningful boost to those who use them; they merely set back those who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Which is to say:

**By *expecting* artists to empower themselves, indie rock effectively *requires* them to do so. Each tool of empowerment then becomes yet another rule to follow.**

### A call for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com). Let's be clear, the best artists *don't* waste time and energy on empowerment; they expect it to come naturally, as a byproduct of building up one's talents. So I'd rather not be *indie*-pendent at all. I want my band to be *inter*-dependent: to have a *label* help us build our fanbase— and, in turn, have this label depend on *us* to make the best art.

By *not* using indie rock's tools, however, I'm seen as lazy and incompetent— and then my band isn't charitably supported as an indie artist would be. But charitable support is such a winning advantage, no other artist can hope to compete unless they're indie as well. In turn, this means the only way for a label to stay competitive is by signing indie artists. So here's my dilemma:

**In trying to make the best art, interdependent bands *need* to reject indie rock's tools. They get punished for this, however, since *every* artist today is expected to be indie— and thus required to follow indie rock's rules.**

But how about a truce? Since rules are made to be followed, interdependent bands can't complain about being penalized. Yet breaking the rules is how rock history gets made! So let's not shut them out either.

### Return of the rock martyrs

The thing is, rock was interdependent once. But as trust eroded, each side took unfortunate yet necessary steps not to need the other. Indie artists now build a fanbase on their own, to show they can walk away from talks with a label. This leaves them with less time and energy to make art, of course— but their fans charitably support them to cover this weakness.

Well, then, can't an interdependent band just promise to make the best art instead? Sadly, no. In a world of charitable support, *all* art is subjective; and in a world of mutual distrust, *nothing* subjective can be a deciding factor. So, in turn, indie labels just weigh the objective size of an artist's fanbase, rather than the artist's talents. What a mess! This leaves only one solution:

**To revive interdependence, a band must spend *all* their time and energy— for untold *years* of their lifetime— on a demo that *objectively* advances the art form and couldn't have been made for *any* less effort.**

So rock is just waiting for… a martyr. But martyrs are the ones who make history! Which is why I spent 25,000 hours— *twelve* full-time years!— on [*Yearling's Bobtail*](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com). And, of course, it was precisely by *not* building a fanbase that I was free to code and illustrate the audio webcomic. Surely even an indie label would be happy with this tradeoff!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

Well… not so fast. As barriers to entry are lowered, the applicant pool gets flooded. This overwhelms the indie labels, making it all the more crucial for artists to use indie rock's tools, which serve to keep every work bite-sized and uniform with others.

${'  ' || `
But there's more to it than that.

Subjectiveness of art form, whereas objectiveness of people.

An indie gatekeeper's obligation isn't to some abstract notion of an art form. It's to the very real people who chose to follow their rules.

The indie gatekeepers are morally obligated to suppress any attempts to innovate by breaking their rules, because this is what the artists who trusted them by following the rules expect.

Their loyalty is to the indie artists who need to be reassured that innovation *isn't* possible for any other artist.

The assurance that more time and energy redirected away from the hustle, and back toward the craft, can never again be a possibility.

It's easy from our perspective to assume that advancing the art form is always the best.

Put yourself in the shoes of an indie gatekeeper, however. And you understand that having set the rules, rewarding those who break them would be a heartless betrayal of those who followed them.

Having promised that advancement can happen if an artist hustles to build a fanbase, you're now morally obligated to suppress any possibility of innovation that comes from diverting time and energy away from the hustle, back toward the craft.
`}

But the biggest problem is that indie rock is the postmodern era's first decentralized system of exposure. Postmodernism means that artists still get rewarded for making well-crafted works, *but* they're no longer punished if they *don't*. Meanwhile, decentralization rewards artists who build a fanbase, *and* it punishes those who *don't*. The net effect, then, is this:

**Indie rock *doesn't* see its rules as an unfortunate necessity; to the contrary, they're its celebrated *purpose*. As such, it will shut out any band trying to revive interdependence— and the public has no way to know.**

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Scraps.

For this reason, the indie labels will refuse to hear an ambitious demo that clearly doesn't follow the rules.

But worse, the concept of interdependence *itself* has no way to take root. Once an indie artist builds a fanbase on their *own*, they'll never concede that the best art comes from waiting on a *label* to help with this effort. And having paid their dues, they're now loyal to a status quo in which *every* artist must struggle as inefficiently as *they* once did. So this is the heart of the problem:

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Only way to save rock is centralization.
`}

But the situation isn't hopeless: Some fans *agree* with me that indie rock has made music worse! This is the first step toward reviving interdependence, because budding entrepreneurs see our discontent as their cue to disrupt the rock market. And industry executives in genres that *never* went indie— like hip hop— can jump in and lend their expertise.

So plenty out there would love to hear a demo that advances the art form— they've just lost faith that any artist in rock still *has* such ambitions, given how far indie rock has lowered the barriers to entry. The final step toward reviving interdependence, then, is for an alternative movement to willfully *raise* these barriers. Well, here's the good news!

**Through BYCombo, interdependent bands can now restore the public's faith by paying a steep *cost* of entry: To show their demo in BYCombo's registry, each band must sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime.**

Picture a hundred BYCombo bands. By breaking the rules, they're already making the *disruptive* works of our time; now to revive interdependence, they'll also be making our generation's most *accomplished* works. *This* will be the next revolution in rock history!
