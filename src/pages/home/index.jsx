# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. We're here to launch the interdependence revolution that will bring forth the most historically consequential rock bands of the 21st century!**

How will we fulfill our mission? By enforcing a steep *cost* of entry. Why is this necessary? Here's why…

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock is all about *lowering* the barriers to entry. To do this, it provides tools for artists to build a fanbase without the help of a label: social media analytics, streaming algorithms, distribution services, and so forth.

These tools of empowerment aren't free, though— they cost the artist's time and energy. And yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them; all they do is penalize those who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Which is to say:

**By *expecting* its artists to empower themselves, indie rock effectively *requires* them to do so. It then imposes its rules on *all* unknown artists.**

### A call for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett, from the band [Bobtail Yearlings](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com). It's clear to me that the best artists *don't* waste time and energy on empowerment; it just comes to them as a byproduct of their talent. So I'd rather not be *indie*-pendent at all. I want my band to be *inter*-dependent: to depend on a *label* to build our fanbase— and, in turn, have this label depend on *us* to make the best art.

By not using indie rock's tools, however, I'm seen as lazy and incompetent. And then my band isn't given the same charitable support that puts indie artists ahead— which effectively puts us *behind*. So this is my dilemma:

**In promising to make the best art, interdependent bands *need* to break indie rock's rules— for which they'll be penalized.**

But how about a truce? Since rules are made to be followed, interdependent bands can't complain about facing penalties. Yet breaking the rules is how rock history gets made! So let's not shut them out either.

### Return of the rock martyrs

The thing is, rock was interdependent once. But as trust eroded, each side took unfortunate yet necessary steps not to depend on the other. Indie artists now build a fanbase to show they can walk away from talks with a label. And labels, in turn, just bet on this fanbase instead of the artist's talent. Such a mess! So what's an interdependent band to do?

Sadly, it's no longer enough to promise the best art. In a world of charitable support, all art is subjective; and in a world of distrust, nothing subjective can be a label's deciding factor. So indie artists are just *assumed* to make the best art possible, which frees up their time and energy to build a fanbase that *can* be measured. This leaves only one solution:

**To regain interdependence, a band must spend *all* their time and energy— for untold *years* of their lifetime— on a demo that *objectively* advances the art form and couldn't have been made for *any* less effort.**

In other words, interdependence is waiting for… a rock martyr. But martyrs are the ones who make history! Which is why I spent 25,000 hours— *twelve* full-time years!— on *Yearling's Bobtail*. And by *not* building a fanbase, I was able to invent [doublespeaker rhyme](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/4-odin/?annotation=7), and to code and illustrate the audio webcomic. What label *wouldn't* be happy with this tradeoff?

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

Well… not so fast. As barriers to entry are lowered, the applicant pool gets flooded, which overwhelms the indie gatekeepers. And so they *need* artists to use indie rock's tools, in order to keep every work bite-sized and uniform with others. This means they'll never have patience for an ambitious demo from a band who didn't follow the rules.

But worse, the concept of interdependence *itself* has no way to take root. Once an indie artist puts time and energy into building a fanbase, they'll never agree that the best art comes from *not* doing so. And having paid their dues, they're now loyal to a status quo in which *every* artist has to struggle as inefficiently as *they* did. Which leads to the heart of the problem:

**Indie rock *doesn't* see its rules as an unfortunate necessity; to the contrary, they're its celebrated *purpose*. As such, it will shut out any band trying to regain interdependence— and we'll never hear about it.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

The situation isn't hopeless, though: Some music fans *prefer* rock from its interdependent years, when artists *didn't* rely on charitable support. And industry insiders in other genres, like hip hop, have *only* ever worked interdependently.

Plenty of them would love to hear an ambitious demo that breaks the rules— they're just jaded by indie rock's low barriers to entry, which have led to a surplus of underwhelming artists. Well, here's great news!

**Interdependent bands can earn the public's trust by adding their demo to BYCombo's registry, which has a steep *cost* of entry: a serious chunk of lifetime spent to advance the art form.**

Picture a hundred BYCombo bands. By breaking the rules, they're already making the *disruptive* works of our time; now to regain interdependence, they'll also be making our generation's most *accomplished* works. *This* is the next revolution in rock history!
