# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. Our mission is to launch the interdependence revolution— the next movement in rock history!**

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock aims to lower the barriers to entry by providing artists with tools of empowerment. These tools aren't exactly free: They cost the artist's time and attention. And yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them. So all they do is penalize the few who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! In other words:

**Every tool of empowerment is effectively just another *rule* to follow.**

### Call for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. Personally, I'd rather break the rules. But if everyone felt the same, then breaking the rules would be the new rule! So I understand why my attitude sets me back, and why I get no sympathy when it does. Still, rock history mainly remembers the rule breakers… and I want to be remembered! So how about a truce:

**Since rules are made to be followed, rule breakers can't complain about facing *natural* disadvantages. But since breaking the rules is also how history gets made, let's not impose *systemic* barriers on them as well.**

### A thousand *Yearling's Bobtail*s

So how did *I* choose to overcome my natural disadvantages? Given all the time I saved by *not* using indie rock's tools, I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time *years*!— to make the music and webcomic for *Yearling's Bobtail*.

// TODO: Rule breakers now have to work much harder, not less. The next revolutionaries can be both the Sex Pistols *and* Steely Dan.${'  '}
The more we try to empower artists, the more disadvantaged the rule breakers are. Breaking the rules now requires a band to sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime.
The disadvantage of being a rule breaker is now so great, that to overcome it now requires sacrificing a serious chunk of lifetime.

Now, rule breakers like me aren't common— but we're also not rare! Picture a thousand bands, each sacrificing a serious chunk of lifetime to make an ambitious demo of their own. It would be the next revolution in rock history that we've all been waiting for!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

And yet… I can say from experience that indie rock won't notice such efforts. When barriers to entry are lowered, the gatekeepers become harried. And harried gatekeepers are sticklers for the rules. So every artist *must* use their tools to be given consideration; we'll simply never hear about any who *don't*. This brings us to the heart of the problem:

**Once the gatekeepers fail us by shutting out the rule breakers, there's no way for us to know. Which means they'll be failing us for a long time— and likely already have been.**

### Uniting the rock gadflies

So today's rule breakers face systemic barriers that are now insurmountable.

// TODO: Flesh out${'  '}
Luckily, there are rule breakers among music fans as well, who recognize that they're no longer seeing their own among today's artists, and are now griping about it. They don't want to charitably support indie rock's chosen rule followers. They want to feel awed by fellow rule breakers.

BYCombo harnesses the energy of disgruntled fans who believe rock music has gotten worse, and intellectually understand that indie rock *should* be worse.

When systemic barriers that are insurmountable are put into place

who aren't content to accept whatever the gatekeepers tell them, and are pretty sure that what they're being shown isn't all there is.

But with BYCombo, the public can now discover any bands breaking the rules to make history, who risk being ignored by the indie gatekeepers!
