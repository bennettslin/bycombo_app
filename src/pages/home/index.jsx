# Join the interdependence revolution!

Indie rock has made music worse, and it's not hard to see why. Labels are too busy to learn who's out there, which forces artists to waste time and energy on increasingly worthless signals, such as touring at a loss.

BYCombo fixes this mess by assembling bands who are committed to making demos for works of historical consequence. We promise the labels that solid chunks of lifetime went into each demo; and we promise the bands that every demo is given fair consideration. So labels can know who's out there, and bands can focus on what matters.

### What we're looking for

### What we'll do for you

Are you an unknown artist who's ready to craft a masterpiece? If you're willing to move to a major city and commit forty hours a week for as many years as it takes, then BYCombo is here for you.

We'll put you in a band with others as ambitious as you are, help you develop your big idea, provide you with a supportive community, and work with the gatekeepers to ensure your masterpiece is given fair consideration.

And BYCombo isn't just for musicians. We welcome anyone who hopes to challenge the accepted notion of who belongs in a band and what a band creates. Comic book artists, game developers, and all others, we'd love to hear from you!
