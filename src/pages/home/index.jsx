# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. We're here to launch the interdependence revolution that will bring forth the most consequential rock bands of the 21st century!**

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock loves to back the underdog, which is why it's all about lowering the barriers to entry. To do this, it provides tools that any artist can use to build a fanbase without label support.

These tools of empowerment aren't free, though: They cost the artist's time and energy. And yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them. All they do is penalize those who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Which is to say:

**By *expecting* artists to empower themselves, the indie culture effectively *requires* them to do so. It then imposes its rules on *all* artists.**

### A call for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. Let's face it, the best artists *don't* waste time and energy on self-empowerment; it comes as a byproduct of their worth. So I refuse to use indie rock's tools; I'd rather not be *indie*-pendent at all. I want my band to be *inter*-dependent: to depend on a *label* to build our fanbase— and, in turn, have this label depend on *us* to make the best art.

// TODO. The idea is there?${'  '}
Not building a fanbase, however, makes me seem lazy and incompetent. This then marks my band ineligible for charitable support, which is now the only way for artists to advance. So this is my dilemma:

**An interdependent band committed to making the best art will need to break the indie culture's rules, for which they'll face penalties.**

But how about a truce? Since rules are made to be followed, interdependent bands can't complain about being penalized. And yet breaking the rules is how rock history gets made! So let's not shut them out either.

### Return of the rock martyrs

// TODO: First paragraph: How we lost interdependence. Lost trust.${'  '}
Rock was once interdependent. So how did it devolve into this inefficient mess?
This way of thinking isn't new to rock; we just lost it. Interdependence requires trust between partners, so it's really hard to regain once that trust is broken. Each side digs in further not to need the other. This is what happened in rock. So how do we get it back?

// TODO: How to get interdependence back. Must be initiated by bands. Why indie rock *can't* make the best art, and to take the opposite approach to make the best art. And to embrace the fact that this makes a band helpless without a partner.${'  '}
Another penalty I faced early on is that by not putting *any* time or energy into building a fanbase on my own, I was treated as lazy and incompetent. To counter this misjudgment, then, I needed to pour *all* my time and energy into advancing the art form, with an ambitious demo that *couldn't* have been made for any less effort.

// TODO: What a band needs to do.${'  '}
**To regain interdependence, bands must sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime to make the best art, all the while shouldering the entire burden and having their intentions misjudged.**

In other words, interdependence is just waiting for… rock martyrs. So I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time *years*!— to make *Yearling's Bobtail*. And by *not* building a fanbase, I was able to invent doublespeaker rhyme and the audio webcomic. What label *wouldn't* be happy with this tradeoff?

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

Well… not so fast. As barriers to entry are lowered, the indie gatekeepers grow harried. So artists *must* use indie rock's tools, which serve to keep works bite-sized and uniform with all others. This means the gatekeepers won't ever bother with an ambitious demo from a band who clearly didn't follow the rules.

But worse, the concept of interdependence *itself* can never take root, since no indie artist will ever concede that the best art comes from *not* being indie. As they see it, building a fanbase is what proved *their* worth, which makes it the true measure of *every* artist to come. And this is the heart of the problem:

**The indie culture *doesn't* see its rules as an unfortunate necessity; to the contrary, they're its celebrated *purpose*. As such, it will shut out any band trying to regain interdependence— and we'll never know.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

The situation might seem hopeless, but there's good news: Some music fans would rather break the rules as well! They dispute the claim that indie rock backs the underdog, since working-class minorities are the *least* eager to lower the barriers to entry. And how do indie artists who require charitable support stand *any* chance to make rock history, anyway?

// TODO: Final${'  '}
These music fans will have no trouble embracing interdependence because… so they just need to know about the bands trying to bring it back.

The fact is, rock was *once* interdependent, and hip hop has never *not* been. The concept is solid; rock just needs to see it proven once more. And I can't be the only one who gets this. Picture a hundred bands, each advancing the art form with an ambitious demo of their own! The world would then see:

**By breaking the indie culture's rules, interdependent bands will be making the most disruptive *and* most accomplished works of our time. *This* is the next revolution in rock history!**
