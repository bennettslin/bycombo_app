# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. Our mission is to launch the interdependence revolution, and to support the bands who'll make interdependence the most consequential rock movement of the century!**

### Tools… are *rules*

To lower the barriers to entry, indie rock provides artists with tools to build a fanbase without label support. These tools of empowerment aren't free: They cost the artist's time and energy. Yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them. So all they do is penalize those who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Which is to say:

**Once artists are *expected* to empower themselves, they're effectively *required* to do so. The indie culture then imposes these rules on *all* artists.**

### A call for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. I think it's clear that the best artists *don't* waste time and energy on self-empowerment; it's just a byproduct of their worth. So I refuse to use indie rock's tools; I don't want to be indie at *all*. I want my band to be *interdependent*: to depend on a *label* to build our fanbase— and, in turn, have this label depend on *us* to make the best art. Which leads to my problem:

**An interdependent band trying to make the best art will be breaking the indie culture's rules, and penalized for it.**

How about a truce? Since rules are made to be followed, interdependent bands can't complain about being penalized. But breaking the rules is also how rock history gets made! So let's not shut them out either.

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

One penalty I faced early on is that by refusing to put *any* time or energy into being indie, I was seen as arrogant and lazy. To correct this misreading, then, I needed to pour *all* my time and energy into advancing the art form, with an ambitious demo that *couldn't* have been made for any less effort.

So I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time *years*!— to make *Yearling's Bobtail*. And by *not* building a fanbase, I was free to invent doublespeaker rhyme and create the audio webcomic. After all, if my band can make the best art, then some label will *help* us build a fanbase.

The fact is, rock was *once* interdependent, while hip hop has never *not* been. The concept is solid; rock just needs to prove it once more. And I can't be the only one who gets this. Picture a hundred bands, each advancing the art form with an ambitious demo of their own! The world would soon understand:

**By breaking the rules, interdependent bands will be making the most disruptive *and* most accomplished works of our time. *This* is the next revolution we're all waiting for!**

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

Well… not so fast. As barriers to entry are lowered, indie labels grow harried; and harried labels have no patience for ambitious demos. Instead, every artist hoping for their consideration *must* follow the rules and use indie rock's tools. We'll just never hear about any who *don't*.

But worse, the very *concept* of interdependence can never take root, because no indie artist will *ever* concede that the best art comes from *not* being indie. If you aren't spending time and energy to empower yourself like they did, then you don't exist— *end of story*. And all those who support them *must* embrace this view. This brings us to the heart of the problem:

**Once the indie culture fails us by shutting out the interdependent bands who would otherwise start the next revolution, we'll never know. Which means it'll be failing us for a long time— and likely already *has* been.**

### An anti-indie counterculture

The situation might seem hopeless, but there's good news: Some music fans would rather break the rules as well! They dispute the claim that indie rock backs the underdog; after all, working-class minorities are the *least* eager to lower the barriers to entry. And how do indie artists who need our charitable support stand *any* chance to make rock history, anyway?

// TODO: Flesh out${'  '}
These disgruntled fans are rock's last hope. They already have the *will* to challenge the indie gatekeepers. Now with BYCombo, they finally have the *way*.
