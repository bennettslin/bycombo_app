# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of interdependent rock bands. We're here to launch the interdependence revolution, a movement devoted to bringing forth this century's most historically consequential rock music!**

Of course, *indie*-pendence is the dominant ideology in rock today. So why is *inter*-dependence needed as an alternative? Here's why…

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock loves to help the underdog, which is why it's all about lowering the barriers to entry for artists. To do this, it provides them with tools to build a fanbase on their own: distribution services, streaming algorithms, social media analytics, and so forth.

These tools of empowerment aren't free, though— they cost the artist's time and energy. And yet, since they're available to *every* artist, they don't give a meaningful boost to those who use them; they merely set back those who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Which is to say:

**By *expecting* artists to empower themselves, indie rock effectively *requires* them to do so. Each tool of empowerment then becomes yet another rule to follow.**

### A call for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com). Let's be clear, the best artists *don't* waste time and energy on empowerment; they know it just comes naturally, as a byproduct of developing one's talents. So I'd rather not be *indie*-pendent at all. I want my band to be *inter*-dependent: to have a *label* help us build our fanbase— and, in turn, have this label depend on *us* to make the best art.

By *not* using indie rock's tools, however, I'm seen as lazy and incompetent— and then my band isn't charitably supported as an indie artist would be. But charitable support is such a winning advantage, the only way any other artist can compete is to be indie as well. In turn, this means the only way a label can stay competitive is to sign indie artists. So here's my dilemma:

**In trying to make the best art, interdependent bands *need* to reject indie rock's tools. They suffer a penalty for this, however, since *every* artist today is expected to be indie— and thus required to follow indie rock's rules.**

But how about a truce? Since rules are made to be followed, interdependent bands can't complain about being penalized. Yet breaking the rules is how rock history gets made! So let's not shut them out either.

### Return of the rock martyrs

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Reconcile these two paragraphs. Don't need two paragraphs about fanbases.

Put charitable support making art subjective in the first paragraph. Put labels in turn betting on the fanbase in the second paragraph.
`}

The thing is, rock was interdependent once. But as trust eroded, each side took unfortunate yet necessary steps not to depend on the other. Indie artists now build a fanbase to show they can walk away from talks with a label. And indie labels, in turn, now just bet on this fanbase instead of the artist's talents. Such a mess! So what's an interdependent band to do?

Sadly, it's no longer enough to promise the best art. In a world of charitable support, all art is subjective; and in a world of distrust, nothing subjective can be a label's deciding factor. So indie artists are just *assumed* to make the best art possible, which frees up their time and energy to build a fanbase whose size *can* be objectively measured. This leaves only one solution:

**To revive interdependence, a band must spend *all* their time and energy— for untold *years* of their lifetime— on a demo that *objectively* advances the art form and couldn't have been made for *any* less effort.**

In other words, rock is just waiting for… a martyr. But martyrs are the ones who make history! Which is why I spent 25,000 hours— *twelve* full-time years!— on [*Yearling's Bobtail*](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com). And by *not* building a fanbase, I was able to code and illustrate the audio webcomic. Surely even an indie label would be happy with this tradeoff?

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

Well… not so fast. As barriers to entry are lowered, the applicant pool gets flooded. This overwhelms the indie labels, making it all the more crucial that artists use indie rock's tools, which serve to keep every work bite-sized and uniform with others. For this reason, the indie labels will refuse an ambitious demo that clearly doesn't follow the rules.

But worse, the concept of interdependence *itself* has no way to take root. Once an indie artist builds a fanbase on their *own*, they'll never agree that the best art comes from waiting on a *label* to help with this effort. And having paid their dues, they're now loyal to a status quo in which *every* artist must struggle as inefficiently as *they* once did. So this is the heart of the problem:

**Indie rock *doesn't* see its rules as an unfortunate necessity; to the contrary, they're its celebrated *purpose*. As such, it will shut out any band trying to revive interdependence— and the public has no way to know.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

The situation isn't hopeless, though: Most fans prefer rock music from *before* the indie era, when artists *didn't* rely on charitable support; industry insiders in other genres, like hip hop and pop, have *always* worked interdependently; and budding entrepreneurs recognize that the indie labels are just waiting to be disrupted by a new model.

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Continue to work on. Entrepreneurs.
`}

Plenty of them would love to hear an ambitious demo that breaks indie rock's rules— they just have no way to hear about it, given the massive flood pouring in through indie rock's low barriers to entry. What's needed to revive interdependence, then, is for a centralized force to enforce a steep *cost* of entry. Well, here's great news!

**To regain the public's interest, an interdependent band can add their demo to BYCombo's registry, which has a steep *cost* of entry: a serious chunk of lifetime spent to advance the art form.**

Picture a hundred BYCombo bands. By breaking the rules, they're already making the *disruptive* works of our time; now to revive interdependence, they'll also be making our generation's most *accomplished* works. *This* will be the next revolution in rock history!
