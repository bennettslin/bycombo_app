# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. Our mission is to launch the interdependence revolution— the next movement in rock history!**

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock loves to provide artists with tools of empowerment. These tools require the artist's commitment— and yet they offer no advantage, since *every* artist is expected to use them. Instead, they simply penalize those who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! In other words:

**Every tool of empowerment is just another *rule* for artists to follow.**

### A thousand *Yearling's Bobtail*s

Hi, I'm Bennett. Personally, I *hate* rules— but if everyone felt the same, then breaking rules would be the new rule! So I get why my attitude puts me at a disadvantage, which then has to be overcome in other ways. This is why I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time years!— to make the album and audio webcomic for *Yearling's Bobtail*.

Now, rule breakers like me aren't common— but we're also not rare! Picture a thousand bands, each sacrificing a serious chunk of lifetime to make an ambitious demo of their own. It would be the next revolution!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

And yet… I can say from experience that indie rock won't notice such efforts. The indie gatekeepers are too harried to learn who's out there, so the only artists they ever consider are the ones who follow the rules by using their tools. Any artist who *doesn't*— they'll simply never tell us about. And this is the heart of the problem:

**Once the gatekeepers fail us, there's no way for us to know. Which means they'll be failing us for a long time— if they haven't been *already*.**

### How BYCombo works

But with BYCombo, the public can now discover any bands breaking the rules to make history, who risk being ignored by the indie gatekeepers!

### Who we're looking for

BYCombo is open to any artist eager to sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime for the interdependence revolution! You're also one of the following:

* A rock musician— singer, guitarist, drummer…
* A musician of another stripe— cellist, tabla player…
* An artist of some other medium— dancer, web developer…
* A creator with a bold vision for a musical project

Once we put you in a band with three or four others— subject to everyone's approval— you'll all relocate to Los Angeles or another major city. Each of you will then put in enough time on your band project for the sum total to be 25,000 hours.

### What we'll do for you

Through the years, BYCombo will advise you on your band project. If the project requires unique collaborators— acrobats? puppeteers?— we'll help you find them. We'll also include you in a supportive community of other ambitious bands. And finally, the Bobtail Yearlings will help when they can!

Once your demo is complete, we'll send it to any record labels or industry insiders who sign up to hear it first. In exchange for this privilege, they'll promise to give it fair consideration and a timely response.

Finally, we'll add your demo to our public registry. With your help, BYCombo will become the public's trusted resource to hear about all the latest bands sacrificing serious chunks of lifetime to make history!
