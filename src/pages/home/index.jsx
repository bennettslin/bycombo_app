# A thousand *Yearling's Bobtail*s

Hi, it's Bennett. I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time years— making the album and audio webcomic for *Yearling's Bobtail*. Imagine a thousand other bands putting in the same dedication to advance rock music as an art form, each in their own way. This would undeniably be the next revolution!

Yet indie rock punishes such behavior— not by anyone's intent, but because it can't self-correct to align with its ideals. Labels are too busy to learn who's out there, forcing artists to waste time and energy on worthless signals.

BYCombo fixes this mess by assembling bands committed to making highly ambitious demos like *Yearling's Bobtail*. We promise the labels that solid chunks of lifetime went into each demo; and we promise the bands that every demo is given fair consideration. So labels can know who's out there, and bands can focus on what matters.

### What we're looking for

Are you an unknown artist who's ready to craft a masterpiece? If you're willing to move to a major city and commit forty hours a week for as many years as it takes, then BYCombo is here for you.

### What we'll do for you

We'll put you in a band with others as ambitious as you are, help you develop your big idea, provide you with a supportive community, and work with the gatekeepers to ensure your masterpiece is given fair consideration.

And BYCombo isn't just for musicians. We welcome anyone who hopes to challenge the accepted notion of who belongs in a band and what a band creates. Comic book artists, game developers, and all others, we'd love to hear from you!
