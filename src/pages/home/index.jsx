# The BYCombo mission

// TODO: Bands are consequential${'  '}
**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. Our mission is to launch the interdependence revolution, and to support the bands who'll make interdependence the most consequential rock movement of the century!**

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock wants to lower the barriers to entry by providing artists with tools of empowerment. These tools aren't actually free: They cost the artist's time and energy. And yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them. So all they do is punish the ones who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Indie rock's tools are just more *rules*. All of which is to say:

**An indie culture that wants artists to empower themselves will end up imposing rules that *every* artist must follow.**

### A call for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. It's obvious to me that the best artists *don't* waste time and energy on self-empowerment; it's simply a byproduct of their worth. So I refuse to use indie rock's tools. I don't want to be indie at *all*; I'd rather be *interdependent*— to depend on a record label that, in turn, depends on my band to be one of the best. Which leads to my problem:

**Once the indie culture takes over, any interdependent band who tries to be the best… will be breaking the rules to do so.**

How about a truce, though? Since rules are made to be followed, those who break them shouldn't complain about being punished. But at the same time, we *all* know that breaking the rules is how history gets made! So let's not shut out the rule breakers either.

### A thousand *Yearling's Bobtail*s

Because interdependent bands aren't thrilled to put *any* time or energy into using indie rock's tools, they get punished for being lazy and inept. But again, no complaints! So to correct this misreading, their only option is to pour *all* their time and energy into advancing the art form, with an ambitious demo that *couldn't* have been made for any less effort. Yet think of what this means:

**By breaking the rules, interdependent bands won't just be making the *disruptive* works of our time; their works will be this generation's most *accomplished* as well.**

Which is why I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time *years*!— to make the music and webcomic for *Yearling's Bobtail*. I mean, who wouldn't want to be both the next Sex Pistols *and* the next Steely Dan? Picture a thousand bands thinking the same, each with an ambitious demo of their own. It would be the next revolution!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

Well… not so fast. As barriers to entry are lowered, indie rock's gatekeepers grow harried; and harried gatekeepers have no patience for ambitious demos. Instead, every artist hoping for their consideration *must* follow the rules and use their tools. We'll just never hear about any who *don't*.

But worse, the very *concept* of interdependence can never take root, because no indie artist will ever concede that the best art comes from *not* being indie. The way they see it, if you aren't using indie rock's tools, then you're lazy or inept— *end of story*. And everyone who supports them will embrace this view as well. This brings us to the heart of the problem:

**Once the indie culture fails us by shutting out the interdependent bands who hope to start the next revolution, we'll never know. Which means it'll be failing us for a long time— and likely already *has* been.**

### An anti-indie counterculture

// TODO: All of this section${'  '}
The situation might seem hopeless. Luckily, some music fans *also* find indie rock's rules absurd, and would rather break them as well! They know that lowering barriers to entry only raises them elsewhere. And they want to be *awestruck* by artists, not to *support* them. Today's rock just doesn't seem destined to make history, which tells them that something is very wrong.

These disgruntled music fans are rock's last hope. They already have the *will* to challenge the indie gatekeepers. Now with BYCombo, they finally have the *way*.
