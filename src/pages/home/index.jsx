# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. Our mission is to launch the interdependence revolution, and to support the bands who'll make interdependence the most consequential rock movement of the century!**

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock wants to lower the barriers to entry by providing artists with tools of empowerment. These tools aren't actually free: They cost the artist's time and energy. And yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them. So all they do is punish the ones who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Which is to say:

**An indie culture that helps artists to empower themselves will end up imposing rules that *every* artist must follow.**

### A call for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. It seems obvious to me that the best artists *don't* waste time and energy on self-empowerment; it just comes to them as a byproduct of their worth. And so I refuse to use indie rock's tools. I want my band to be *interdependent*— to depend on a record label that, in turn, depends on my band to be one of the best. But think of what this means:

**Once the indie culture takes over, any interdependent band who tries to rank among the best… will be breaking the rules to do so.**

Now, rules are made to be followed, so rule breakers can't complain about being punished. But at the same time, we *all* understand that breaking the rules is how rock history gets made! So let's not shut them out either.

### A thousand *Yearling's Bobtail*s

Because interdependent bands aren't thrilled to put *any* time or energy into self-empowerment, they get punished for being lazy and inept. To correct this misunderstanding, their only option is to pour *all* their time and energy into an ambitious demo that advances the art form— and which *couldn't* have been made for any less effort. So if you think about it:

**By breaking the rules, interdependent bands won't just be making the *disruptive* works of our time; theirs will be the most *accomplished* as well.**

This is why I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time *years*!— to make the music and webcomic for *Yearling's Bobtail*. Who wouldn't want to be both the next Sex Pistols *and* the next Steely Dan? Picture a thousand other bands thinking the same, each with an ambitious demo of their own. It would be the next revolution!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

// TODO: Indie gatekeepers are naturally harried${'  '}
Well… not so fast. When barriers to entry are lowered, the indie gatekeepers become harried; and harried gatekeepers have no patience for ambitious demos. Instead, every artist hoping for their consideration *must* follow the rules and use their tools; we'll simply never hear about any who *don't*.

// TODO: Flesh out${'  '}
But worse, indie artists *can't* coexist with interdependent bands, whom they see as an existential threat. Once we give them power, they will create a system that can never allow for the possibility that an artist can be better by not being indie.

// TODO: Rethink${'  '}
**Once the indie culture fails us by shutting out the interdependent bands who would otherwise start the next revolution, we'll never know. Which means it'll be failing us for a long time— and likely already *has* been.**

### An anti-indie counterculture

// TODO: All of this section${'  '}
The situation might seem hopeless. Luckily, some music fans *also* find indie rock's rules absurd, and would rather break them as well! They know that lowering barriers to entry only raises them elsewhere. And they want to be *awestruck* by artists, not to *support* them. Today's rock just doesn't seem destined to make history, which tells them that something is very wrong.

These disgruntled music fans are rock's last hope. They already have the *will* to challenge the indie gatekeepers. Now with BYCombo, they finally have the *way*.
