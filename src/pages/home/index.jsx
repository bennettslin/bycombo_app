**As a nonprofit, BYCombo is here to bring forth this century's historically canonical rock bands! Our plan is to assemble each band ourselves and then expose them to interdependent-minded business partners.**

Of course, *indie*-pendence is the dominant ideology in rock today. So why is *inter*-dependence needed as an alternative?

Hi, I'm Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com)! Let me explain…

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock roots for the underdog, and so it seeks to lower the barriers to entry for artists. As such, it provides them with tools of empowerment— social media, streaming services, crowdfunding platforms, and so forth— allowing them to bypass the labels and build a fanbase on their own.

Except… here's the problem: These tools only offer an advantage over other artists who *don't* use them— and today, most *do*. So there's no longer much benefit; from here on out, their main purpose is to punish any holdouts. But wait… this is how *rules* work! By encouraging artists to use these tools, indie rock has now made it the *rule* to do so!

And these tools *aren't* free; they cost time and energy that could be spent making art instead. So if you're a band trying to make the *best* art, you won't bother with them— leaving you *worse* off in this new Age of Empowerment! Yet from what I've seen, few others sympathize. Well, how about a truce?

***Yes*— since rules are made to be followed, bands who refuse to empower themselves can't complain about being punished. *But*— breaking the rules is how rock history gets made! So let's not shut them out either.**

### The outsider's dilemma

Here's the curious part: Ever notice that the best rappers *don't* worry about self-empowerment? It comes to them for free— if they just build up enough talents. For example, Eminem *didn't* have a fanbase when he was discovered by Dr. Dre; his self-released EP sold [all of 250 copies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slim_Shady_EP). Why does hip hop work so differently from indie rock?

It's simple: While indie rock was founded by *underdogs*, hip hop was founded by *outsiders*. What's the difference? The public doesn't root for outsiders. So as a minority myself, I'm drawn to hip hop's *inter*-dependent way of thinking. I'd rather be an "Eminem of rock" and have a *partner* advocate for my band— while having this partner, in turn, depend on *us* to make the best art.

By *not* empowering myself, however, I'm dismissed as a hobbyist— and then my band isn't charitably supported as an indie artist would be. But charitable support is such a [winning advantage](/indie#charitable-support-is-a-supreme-advantage), no other artist can hope to compete. Which means the *labels* can only compete by partnering with indie artists… who work hard *not* to need them. What a mess! And yet the future is clear:

**As indie artists grow further empowered, labels will soon have no reason to exist— *unless* they get back to partnering with interdependent bands, who *do* need them… as it's the only way to make the best art!**

### Return of the rock martyrs

And that's the funny part: Rock *was* interdependent once! Well then, can't a band simply promise to make the best art, as before? Sadly, no. In a world of charitable support, all art is now *subjective*; talent predicts nothing. Which means an indie label's only trusted measure is the *objective* size of an artist's fanbase. Good grief… Can we fix this mess?

Yes! See, indie rock has a glaring weakness: It doesn't *actually* separate the best artists from the rest. It picks "serious" artists over "casual" ones— in the faith that this amounts to the same thing. My solution, then, is to show that indie rock's rules, taken to their logical extreme, will force us to dismiss *all* our best artists as hobbyists! Here's how it works:

**To revive interdependence, bands must sacrifice *all* their time and energy, for untold *years* of their lifetime, on a demo that *objectively* advances the art form— and which couldn't have been made with *any* less effort.**

But who'd volunteer to be the first of these new martyrs? A hungry outsider, that's who! Which is why I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time years!— on [*Yearling's Bobtail*](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com). And of course, it was by *not* building a fanbase that I was free to code and illustrate the audio webcomic. Because surely even the indie labels love it when a creative work *needs* to break the rules!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review.

Well… not so fast. Indie rock's basic assumption is that all artists face the same hurdles— so if you just clear a path for the underdog, you'll still help the rest. Except… an outsider's hurdles *aren't* the same. To compensate for *not* being the one you're rooting for, they need to work much harder, to be much better. But then… this makes *them* the underdog's biggest hurdle!

So even as the outsider builds up objective strengths to win over a skeptical public, indie rock's gatekeepers— its labels, curators, and pundits— assure victory for the underdog by keeping their criteria *subjective*! Which explains why they favor music that *lacks* [well-crafted hooks](/indie#timeless-works-have-standalone-appeal), and why they refuse to account for humanity's bias *against* [creative invention](/indie#creativity-gets-its-chance-from-the-clueless).

Suffice it to say, then… the indie labels rejected my demo. They also ignored later projects of mine that promised to *help* their underdogs: [*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com), my songwriting book, and [*Bobtail Dominoes*](https://www.bobtaildominoes.com), my musical tile game. So even *altruism* is a losing strategy for the outsider! And now I finally understood:

**A movement that's kind to the underdog *must* be cruel to the outsider. In other words, indie rock will *never* sympathize with a hungry outsider's need for interdependence— because it *means* to shut them out!**

Worst of all, if the major labels are "bad guys," then the indie labels are "good guys." Well, who finally put the good guys in charge? Millennials! It's their greatest achievement, which they now protect at all costs. So anyone who questions their gatekeepers is a bad guy as well— especially anyone from an [older generation](https://youtu.be/tODG4Xt45bU)! And this gets at the heart of the problem:

**As the first rock movement to believe its ideals to be universal, indie rock is also the first to lock down its rules for good. As such, there's no historical precedent to show us how to dissent— or even to assure us that we *can*.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

But if we can't dissent, then let's revolt! How? We simply… wait. See, indie rock has *another* glaring weakness: When a movement *requires* its artists to divert time and energy away from making art— it has no defense if this art is then accused of being *worse*! So there's already a *way* to revolt against indie rock; we just need the next generation to have the *will*.

Sure enough, Gen Z now sees what the older generations see: Indie rock is their hair metal— making the *next* revolution their grunge! Which is the first step to reviving interdependence in defiance of the indie gatekeepers, as it's only once the *youth* are discontent that an entrepreneur will try to disrupt the rock market.

This "Dr. Dre of rock" would love to partner with bands who promise to make the best art— but how? Too many artists are coming in through indie rock's low barriers to entry. The next step, then, is for a counterculture that *raises* its barriers to emerge. And here's where BYCombo comes in!

**Interdependent bands can now earn a business partner's trust by paying a steep *cost* of entry: To have their demo shown in BYCombo's registry, each band must sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime to advance the art form.**

So picture a hundred BYCombo bands, all of them breaking indie rock's rules to make the most creative works of our times. This is the *final* step to reviving interdependence— the next revolution in rock history!
