**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. Our mission is to assemble interdependent bands committed to making historically consequential demos, and to be a trusted repository of their work.**

# "A thousand *Yearling's Bobtail*s"

Hi, I'm Bennett. It took me 25,000 hours— twelve full-time years!— to make *Yearling's Bobtail*. Now imagine a thousand other bands putting the same time and energy into their own ambitious demos. This would surely be the next revolution!

And yet, indie rock isn't set up to notice such efforts. The labels are too harried to learn who's out there, so artists need to vie for attention by wasting time and energy instead on broken signals, like touring at a loss.

But BYCombo promises the labels that each band spends solid chunks of lifetime on their demo; and we promise the bands that each label gives their demo fair consideration. So labels can know who's out there, while bands can focus on what matters. And the interdependence revolution can begin!

### Who we're looking for

BYCombo is open to anyone who wants to join a band and make history! You should also be one of the following:

* A creator with bold ideas for a musical project
* A rock musician— singer, guitarist, drummer…
* A musician of another stripe— cellist, tabla player…
* An artist of some other medium— novelist, web developer…

If we accept you, we'll put you in a band with three or four others of equal talent, subject to everyone's approval. You'll then relocate with your band to Los Angeles or another US city. Once the band project is decided, you'll each spend enough time on it for the sum total to be 25,000 hours. In a band of four, this works out to forty hours a week for three years.

### What we'll do for you

Through the years, BYCombo will advise you on your project and provide you with a community of similarly ambitious bands. The Bobtail Yearlings will also help when they can!

// TODO
Once your demo is complete, we'll show it to participating labels. We'll also post it on this website afterward.
