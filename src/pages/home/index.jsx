# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. We're here to launch the interdependence revolution that will bring forth the most consequential rock bands of the 21st century!**

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock wants to lower the barriers to entry, so it provides artists with tools to build a fanbase without label support. These tools of empowerment aren't free: They cost the artist's time and energy. Yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them. All they do is penalize those who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Which is to say:

**Once artists are *expected* to empower themselves, they're effectively *required* to do so. The indie culture then imposes these rules on *all* artists.**

### Calling for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. Let's face it, the best artists *don't* waste time and energy on self-empowerment; it's just a byproduct of their worth. So I refuse to use indie rock's tools; I'd rather not be *indie*-pendent at all. I want my band to be *inter*-dependent: to depend on a *label* to build our fanbase— and, in turn, have this label depend on *us* to make the best art. But here's my dilemma:

**An interdependent band committed to making the best art will need to break the indie culture's rules, for which they'll face penalties.**

So how about a truce? Since rules are made to be followed, interdependent bands can't complain when they're penalized. But breaking the rules is also how rock history gets made! So let's not shut them out either.

### Return of the rock martyrs

// TODO: Wording.${'  '}
One penalty I faced early on is that by refusing to put *any* time or energy into being indie, I was seen as arrogant and lazy. To counter this misjudgment, I decided to pour *all* my time and energy into advancing the art form, with an ambitious demo that *couldn't* have been made for any less effort. Some label would then want to *help* my band build a fanbase.

// TODO: Flesh out.${'  '}
Because we've done things this way in rock before; we just lost it. Interdependence requires trust between partners, so it's really hard to regain once that trust is broken. Each side digs in further not to need the other. So it was clear to me:

// TODO: Really think what this should be.${'  '}
**Interdependence can only be regained by a band willing to shoulder *all* the burden, and be misjudged for a long period of time.**

// TODO: Wording.${'  '}
In other words, rock is just waiting on… a martyr. So I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time *years*!— to make *Yearling's Bobtail*. And by *not* building a fanbase, I was able to invent doublespeaker rhyme and create the audio webcomic. But I assumed that would be all. Because surely we haven't lost the *will* to regain interdependence?

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

Well… not so fast. As barriers to entry are lowered, the indie gatekeepers grow harried. So artists *must* use indie rock's tools, which serve to keep works bite-sized and uniform with others. This means the gatekeepers won't ever bother with an ambitious demo from a band who clearly didn't follow the rules.

But worse, the concept of interdependence *itself* can never take root, since no indie artist will ever concede that the best art comes from *not* being indie. As they see it, building a fanbase is what proved *their* worth, which makes it the true measure of *every* artist. And this is the heart of the problem:

// TODO: Reword?${'  '}
**The indie culture has no will to regain interdependence. So it will fail us by shutting out any interdependent band, and we'll just never know. Which means it'll be failing us for a long time— and likely already has been.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

The situation might seem hopeless, but there's good news: Some music fans would rather break the rules as well! They dispute the claim that indie rock backs the underdog, since working-class minorities are the *least* eager to lower the barriers to entry. And how do indie artists who require charitable support stand *any* chance to make rock history, anyway?

// TODO: Final${'  '}
These music fans will have no trouble embracing interdependence because… so they just need to know about the bands trying to bring it back.

The fact is, rock was *once* interdependent, and hip hop has never *not* been. The concept is solid; rock just needs to see it proven once more. And I can't be the only one who gets this. Picture a hundred bands, each advancing the art form with an ambitious demo of their own! The world would then see:

**By breaking the indie culture's rules, interdependent bands will be making the most disruptive *and* most accomplished works of our time. *This* is the next revolution we're all waiting for!**
