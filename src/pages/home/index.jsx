# The BYCombo mission

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Just one more final review.
`}

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of self-sacrificing rock bands. We're here to launch the interdependence revolution, a movement devoted to bringing forth this century's most historically consequential rock music!**

Of course, *indie*-pendence is the dominant ideology in rock today. So why is *inter*-dependence needed as an alternative? Here's why…

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock roots for the underdog, which is why it's all about lowering the barriers to entry for artists. To do this, it provides them with tools to bypass the labels and build a fanbase on their own: distribution services, streaming algorithms, social media analytics, and so forth.

These tools aren't free, though— they cost the artist's time and energy. And yet, since they're available to *every* artist, they hardly boost all those who use them; they merely penalize the few who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Which is to say:

**By *expecting* artists to empower themselves, indie rock effectively *requires* them to do so. Each tool of self-empowerment then becomes yet another rule to follow.**

So these tools… are now indie rock's *rules*. And since rules are made to be followed, rule breakers can't complain about being penalized. But breaking the rules is also how history gets made! So let's not shut them out, either.

### The outsider's dilemma

Hi, I'm Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com/essays/ongoing/band-mission-and-principles). Ever notice that the best rappers *don't* worry about empowerment? It comes to them for free, if they just build up their talents. For example, Eminem *didn't* have a real fanbase before he was discovered by Dr. Dre; his EP sold [all of 250 copies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slim_Shady_EP). Why does hip hop work so differently from indie rock?

It's simple: While indie rock was founded by *underdogs*, hip hop was founded by *outsiders*. What's the difference? The public doesn't root for outsiders. So as a minority myself, I'm drawn to hip hop's way of thinking. I want my band to be *inter*-dependent: to have a *label* build our fanbase— and, in turn, have this label depend on *us* to make the best art.

By *not* using indie rock's tools, however, I'm seen as a hobbyist— and then my band isn't charitably supported as an indie artist would be. But charitable support is such a winning advantage, no other artist can hope to compete. Which means the labels can only compete by signing indie artists— who work hard *not* to need them! What a mess… And yet the future is clear:

**As indie artists grow further empowered, labels will soon have no reason to exist— *unless* they get back to signing interdependent bands, who *do* need them… as it's the only way to make the best art!**

### Return of the rock martyrs

And that's the funny part: Rock *was* interdependent once! Well, then, can't a band simply promise to make the best art, as before? Sadly, no. In a world of charitable support, *all* art is now subjective; talent predicts nothing. This means an indie label's *only* trusted measure is the objective size of an artist's fanbase. Good grief… Can rock be saved?

Yes! See, indie rock has a glaring weakness. It doesn't *actually* separate the best artists from the worst; it simply picks "serious" artists over "casual" ones, in the faith that this amounts to the same thing. My solution, then, is to show that indie rock's rules, taken to their logical extreme, will *force* us to dismiss all the best artists as hobbyists! Here's how it works:

**To save rock, interdependent bands must spend *all* their time and energy— for untold *years* of their lifetime— on a demo that *objectively* advances the art form, and which couldn't have been made with *any* less effort.**

So rock is waiting on… a self-sacrificing martyr. But martyrs are the ones who make history! As such, I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time years— on [*Yearling's Bobtail*](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com). And, of course, it was by *not* building a fanbase that I was free to code and illustrate the audio webcomic. Because surely even the indie labels love it when a creative work *needs* to break their rules!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

Well… not so fast. As barriers to entry are lowered, the applicant pool gets flooded, overwhelming the indie labels and other gatekeepers. This makes them insist all the more firmly that artists use indie rock's tools, which serve to keep every work bite-sized and uniform. And so they largely ignored my demo, as it wasn't in a format they expected.

It's worse than just that, however. Since underdogs lose to outsiders in a fair fight, indie rock is set up to *reject* the outsider's go-to strengths: sheer talent and creative invention. This is why it prizes works admired by critics, who root for underdogs— but *not* those [envied by musicians](/indie#history-is-made-through-peer-review), who don't; and why it disputes the science that tells us creativity runs [*counter* to our intuition](/indie#creativity-gets-its-chance-from-the-clueless).

The indie gatekeepers also ignored my later projects that would have *helped* their artists: [*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com), my songwriting book, and [*Bobtail Dominoes*](https://www.bobtaildominoes.com), my musical tile game. So even *altruism* is a losing strategy for the outsider, since underdogs are actually *loved* for [helping themselves](/indie#a-artists-help-a-artists-b-artists-help-c-artists) and [not others](/indie#art-needs-the-blood-of-martyrs)!

Worst of all, if the major labels are "bad guys," then the indie labels are "good guys." Well, who *finally* put the good guys in charge? Millennials! It's their greatest achievement, which they now protect at all costs. So anyone who questions their gatekeepers— especially anyone from an older generation— is a [bad guy as well](https://youtu.be/tODG4Xt45bU)! And this is the heart of the problem:

**As the first rock movement to believe its ideals to be universal, indie rock is also the first to lock down its rules for good. As such, there's no historical precedent to show us how to dissent— or even to assure us that we *can*.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

But if we can't dissent… then let's revolt! By some miracle, Gen Z sides with the *older* generations; *they* want to save rock as well! And their discontent is the first step toward reviving interdependence from the *outside*: It tells potential business partners that the rock market is ripe for disruption.

These Dr. Dres of rock would love to meet with bands who can promise to make the best art— but how will they find each other, given all the noise coming in through indie rock's low barriers to entry? The next step, then, is for an alternative source to willfully *raise* its barriers. And here's where BYCombo comes in!

**To earn the listener's trust, interdependent bands can show their demo in BYCombo's public registry by paying a steep *cost* of entry: Each band must sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime to advance the art form.**

Picture a hundred BYCombo bands, all of them breaking indie rock's rules to make the most creative works of our times— while *still* being dismissed as hobbyists by the indie gatekeepers. They would be this generation's Beatles, Sex Pistols, *and* Shaggs, all rolled into one. This, then, is the *final* step toward reviving interdependence— the next revolution in rock history!
