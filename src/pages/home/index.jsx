# A thousand *Yearling's Bobtail*s

Hi, it's Bennett. I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time years— making the album and audio webcomic for *Yearling's Bobtail*. Now imagine a thousand other bands putting in the same time and energy to advance rock music, each in their own way. This would undeniably be the next revolution!

Yet indie rock will ignore any such efforts. Since the labels are too busy to learn what's out there, artists are forced to vie for attention by wasting time and energy instead on worthless signals.

But BYCombo can fix this mess! To the labels, we promise that each band spends a solid chunk of lifetime on their demo; and to the bands, we promise that each label gives their demo fair consideration. So labels can know who's out there, and bands can focus on what matters.

### Who we're looking for

BYCombo is looking for anyone who wants to join a band and be part of the interdependence revolution! You're at least one of the following:

* A creator with bold ideas for a project
* A rock musician— singer, guitarist, drummer
* A musician of another stripe— throatsinger, tabla player
* An artist of some other medium— dancer, web developer

After relocating to Los Angeles or another major city, you'll commit forty hours a week for three or more years to the making of an ambitious demo. When the demo is complete, you'll perform all the expected duties of a full band member.

### What we'll do for you

BYCombo will put you in a band with other members of comparable talent, subject to everyone's approval. Through the years, we'll help you develop your band's project and provide you with a community of like-minded bands. The Bobtail Yearlings will also help however they can.

Once your demo is completed, we'll send it to participating labels. We'll then post it on this website afterward, making it discoverable to anyone looking for a disciplined band that made an ambitious 25,000-hour demo.
