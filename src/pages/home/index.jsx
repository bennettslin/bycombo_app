# The BYCombo mission

// TODO: Revisit${'  '}
**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. Our mission is to sustain an anti-indie counterculture and launch the interdependence revolution, the most historically consequential movement in rock music of the 21st century.**

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock aims to lower the barriers to entry by providing artists with tools of empowerment. These tools aren't exactly free: They cost the artist's time and attention. And yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them. So all they do is penalize the ones who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! In other words:

**Every tool of empowerment is effectively just another *rule* to follow.**

### Call for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. I think indie rock's rules hurt the art form, and I refuse to follow them. Yet if everyone felt this way, then breaking the rules… would be the new rule! So I understand why this attitude sets me back, and why I get no sympathy for it. At the same time, we all know that the art form advances only when a few dare to break the rules. So how about a truce:

**Since rules are made to be followed, rule breakers can't complain about facing *natural* disadvantages. But since they're also the ones most likely to make history, let's not *systematically* shut them out either.**

### A thousand *Yearling's Bobtail*s

// TODO: Rephrase${'  '}
A big disadvantage is that once tools of empowerment are available, then any artist who *doesn't* use them gets dismissed as lazy or inept. So to counter this misunderstanding, a rule breaker's only real option is to put in far *more* time to make art of far *greater* consequence. But think of what this means:

**Rule breakers won't just be making the *disruptive* works of our time— they'll also be giving us our most *accomplished* works as well.**

// TODO: Rephrase${'  '}
This is why I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time *years*!— to make the music and webcomic for *Yearling's Bobtail*. Now picture a thousand bands with the same thought, each putting out an ambitious demo of their own. It would be the next revolution!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

// TODO: Rephrase${'  '}
And yet… indie rock isn't set up to notice. When barriers to entry are lowered, gatekeepers become harried; and harried gatekeepers have no patience for ambitious demos. Instead, every artist hoping for their consideration *must* follow the rules by using their tools; we'll simply never hear about any who *don't*. And this is the heart of the problem:

**Once the gatekeepers fail us by shutting out the rule breakers, there's no way for us to know. Which means they'll be failing us for a long time— and likely already *have been*.**

### A nation of gadflies
// TODO: Finalize heading${'  '}

The situation might seem hopeless. Luckily, some music fans *also* find indie rock's rules absurd, and would rather break them as well! They know that lowering barriers to entry only raises them elsewhere. And they want to be *awestruck* by artists, not to *support* them. Today's rock just doesn't seem destined to make history, which tells them that something is very wrong.

Intuitively recognize that today's rule breakers are making ambitious demos.

// TODO: Socratic gadfly${'  '}
These disgruntled music fans are rock's last hope. They already have the *will* to challenge the indie gatekeepers. Now with BYCombo, they finally have the *way*.
