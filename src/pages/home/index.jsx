# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. We're here to launch the interdependence revolution— the next movement in rock history!**

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock loves to provide artists with tools of empowerment. These tools require the artist's time and commitment— yet they offer no advantage over others, since *every* artist is expected to use them. Instead, they just penalize the few who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! In other words:

**Every tool of empowerment is just one more *rule* to follow.**

### Calling for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. Personally, I *hate* rules— yet if everyone felt the same, then breaking the rules would be the new rule! So I get why my attitude sets me back. But… I'm going to break the rules anyway. Because rock history mainly remembers the rule breakers, and I want to be remembered! So how about this for a truce:

**Since rules are made to be followed, rule breakers can't complain about facing *natural* disadvantages. But since breaking the rules is also how history gets made, let's not impose *systemic* barriers on them as well.**

### A thousand *Yearling's Bobtail*s

So how did *I* choose to overcome my natural disadvantages? Given all the time I saved by *not* using indie rock's tools, I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time *years*!— to make the music and webcomic for *Yearling's Bobtail*.

Now, rule breakers like me aren't common— but we're also not rare! Picture a thousand other bands, each sacrificing a serious chunk of lifetime to advance the art form with a demo of their own. It would be the next revolution!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

And yet… I can say from experience that indie rock won't notice such efforts. The indie gatekeepers are too harried to learn who's out there, so the only artists they ever consider are the ones who follow the rules. Any artist who *doesn't*— they'll simply never tell us about. And this is the heart of the problem:

**Once the gatekeepers fail us, there's no way for us to know. Which means they'll be failing us for a long time— if they haven't been *already*.**

// TODO: Reconsider whether to have this paragraph at all${'  '}
So indie rock has violated our truce, and now these systemic barriers are insurmountable. To be fair, maybe the gatekeepers don't realize that they're shutting out the rule breakers. Breaking the rules now requires *more* effort, not *less*, and this role reversal is fairly recent.

because they still expect them to come from the opposite extreme! there *has* been a role reversal: .

### Uniting the rock gadflies

// TODO: Flesh out${'  '}
Luckily, there are rule breakers among music fans as well, who recognize that they're no longer seeing their own among today's artists— they're just unclear on the reason.

who aren't content to accept whatever the gatekeepers tell them, and are pretty sure that what they're being shown isn't all there is.

But with BYCombo, the public can now discover any bands breaking the rules to make history, who risk being ignored by the indie gatekeepers!
