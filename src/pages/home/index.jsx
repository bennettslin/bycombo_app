# The BYCombo mission

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Add link for "Five vowels" to "historically consequential," both here and on the About page.
`}

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of self-sacrificing rock bands. We're here to launch the interdependence revolution, a movement devoted to bringing forth this century's most historically consequential rock music!**

Of course, *indie*-pendence is the dominant ideology in rock today. So why is *inter*-dependence needed as an alternative? Here's why…

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock loves to help the underdog, which is why it's all about lowering the barriers to entry for artists. To do this, it provides them with tools to build a fanbase on their own: distribution services, streaming algorithms, social media analytics, and so forth.

These tools of empowerment aren't free, though— they cost the artist's time and energy. And yet, since they're available to *every* artist, they don't give any meaningful boost to those who use them; they merely set back those who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Which is to say:

**By *expecting* artists to empower themselves, indie rock effectively *requires* them to do so. Each tool of empowerment then becomes yet another rule to follow.**

### A call for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com). Let's be clear, the best artists *don't* waste time and energy on empowerment; they expect it to come naturally, as a byproduct of building up their talents. So I'd rather not be *indie*-pendent at all. I want my band to be *inter*-dependent: to have a *label* help us build our fanbase— and, in turn, have this label depend on *us* to make the best art.

By *not* using indie rock's tools, however, I'm seen as lazy and incompetent— and then my band isn't charitably supported as an indie artist would be. But charitable support is such a winning advantage, no other artist can hope to compete unless they're indie as well. In turn, this means a label can stay competitive only by signing indie artists. So here's my dilemma:

**In trying to make the best art, interdependent bands *need* to reject indie rock's tools. They get punished for this, however, since *every* artist today is expected to be indie— and thus required to follow indie rock's rules.**

But how about a truce? Since rules are made to be followed, interdependent bands can't complain about being penalized. Yet breaking the rules is how the most creative works in history get made! So let's not shut out these bands either.

### Return of the rock martyrs

The thing is, rock was interdependent once. But as trust eroded, each side took unfortunate yet necessary steps not to need the other. Indie artists now build a fanbase on their own, to show they can walk away from talks with a label. This leaves them with less time and energy to make art, of course— but their fans charitably support them to cover this weakness.

Well, then, can't an interdependent band just promise to make the best art instead? Sadly, no. In a world of charitable support, *all* art is subjective; and in a world of mutual distrust, *nothing* subjective can be a deciding factor. So, in turn, indie labels now just weigh the objective size of an artist's fanbase, rather than their talents. What a mess! This leaves only one solution:

**To revive interdependence, a band must spend *all* their time and energy— for untold *years* of their lifetime— on a demo that *objectively* advances the art form and couldn't have been made for *any* less effort.**

So rock is just waiting for… a self-sacrificing martyr. But martyrs are the ones who make history! Which is why I spent 25,000 hours— *twelve* full-time years!— on [*Yearling's Bobtail*](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com). And, of course, it was precisely by *not* building a fanbase that I was free to code and illustrate the audio webcomic. Surely even an indie label would be happy with this tradeoff!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

Well… not so fast. As barriers to entry are lowered, the applicant pool gets flooded, overwhelming the indie labels and other gatekeepers. This makes them insist all the more firmly that artists use indie rock's tools, which serve to keep every work bite-sized and uniform with others. And so they lose patience when a band gets creative and breaks the rules.

It's worse than just that, however: Because these indie gatekeepers came up from their local scenes, they're seen as the "good guys." Everyone trusts their judgment, so whatever they like is accepted as the final verdict. But… studies show that it's human nature to [*dislike* creativity](https://slate.com/technology/2013/12/creativity-is-rejected-teachers-and-bosses-dont-value-out-of-the-box-thinking.html)!

Creative ideas are unfamiliar, and this makes us uncomfortable. Now, the corporate "bad guys" just ignore this discomfort, since it's *all* unfamiliar to them. But the good guys pride themselves on their hard-won instincts, so they interpret the discomfort as a sincere warning from their gut. Ironically, then, as [Frank Zappa noted](https://youtu.be/xP4wsURn3rw), this makes them *worse* at discovering creativity!

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Make this about locking in a permanent system of administration. A permanent status quo, where revolution isn't possible.

Because indie rock sees its rules as morally perfect, it
`}

But worst of all, as the good guys, the indie gatekeepers are morally obligated to lock in a permanent system of administration, and then suppress any future revolution that might undo their work. And this is the heart of the problem:

**Indie rock isn't a genre that can coexist with others; it's an ideology that must *suppress* all future revolutions. As such, it will shut out any band trying to revive interdependence— and the public will never know.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Mention young people again.
`}

But the situation isn't hopeless: Some fans *agree* with me that indie rock has made music worse! This is the first step toward reviving interdependence, because budding entrepreneurs see our discontent as their cue to disrupt the rock market. And industry executives in genres that *never* went indie— like hip hop— can jump in and lend their expertise.

So plenty out there would love to hear a demo that advances the art form— they've just lost faith that any artist in rock still *has* such ambitions, given how far indie rock has lowered the barriers to entry. The final step toward reviving interdependence, then, is for an alternative movement to willfully *raise* these barriers. Well, BYCombo has some great news!

**Interdependent bands can now restore the public's faith by paying a steep *cost* of entry: To have their demo shown in BYCombo's registry, each band must sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime.**

Picture a hundred BYCombo bands. By breaking indie rock's rules, they'll be making the most creative *and* most disruptive works of our time. *This* will be the next revolution in rock history!
