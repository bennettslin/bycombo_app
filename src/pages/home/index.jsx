# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. Our mission is to launch the interdependence revolution— the next movement in rock history!**

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock aims to lower the barriers to entry by providing artists with tools of empowerment. These tools aren't exactly free: They cost the artist's time and attention. And yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them. So all they do is penalize the ones who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! In other words:

**Every tool of empowerment is effectively just another *rule* to follow.**

### Calling for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. I find indie rock's rules absurd, and I refuse to follow them. Yet if everyone felt this way, then breaking the rules… would be the new rule! So I understand that my attitude hurts me alone, and why I get no sympathy for this. Still, rock history remembers the rule breakers above all else— and I *will* be remembered! So how about a truce:

**Since rules are made to be followed, rule breakers can't complain about facing *natural* disadvantages. But since breaking the rules is how history gets made, let's not put up *systemic* barriers to shut them out either.**

### A thousand *Yearling's Bobtail*s

So rather than complain, I eventually spent 25,000 hours to make the music and webcomic for *Yearling's Bobtail*— that's twelve full-time *years*! But it was worth it. Had I chosen to empower myself using indie rock's tools instead, an idea like doublespeaker rhyme never would have come to me. Which leads to an observation:

**To overcome their disadvantages, today's rule breakers have only one option: Sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime to make consequential art.**

But think about what this means: Rule breakers won't just be making the *disruptive* works of our time— they'll be giving us our most *accomplished* works as well! So picture a thousand bands, each trying to do just that, with an ambitious demo of their own. It would be the next revolution!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

And yet… indie rock isn't set up to care. When barriers to entry are lowered, gatekeepers become harried; and harried gatekeepers have no patience for ambitious demos. Instead, every artist hoping for their consideration *must* follow the rules by using their tools. We'll simply never hear about any who *don't*. And this is the heart of the problem:

**Once the gatekeepers fail us by shutting out the rule breakers, there's no way for us to know. Which means they'll be failing us for a long time— and likely already *have been*.**

### A nation of gadflies
// TODO: Finalize heading${'  '}

The situation might seem hopeless. Luckily, there are rule breakers among music fans as well! They're the ones who refuse to be gaslit when indie rock insists that rock has never been better. Artists should be filling us with awe, not asking for support! Today's rock just doesn't seem destined for historical consequence, and this tells them that something is very wrong.

Intuitively recognize that today's rule breakers are making ambitious demos.

// TODO: Socratic gadfly${'  '}
These disgruntled music fans are rock's last hope. They already have the *will* to challenge the indie gatekeepers. Now with BYCombo, they finally have the *way*.
