# A thousand *Yearling's Bobtail*s

Hi, I'm Bennett. It took me 25,000 hours— twelve full-time years!— to make the album and audio webcomic for *Yearling's Bobtail*. Now imagine a thousand other bands putting the same time and energy into their own demos. This would surely be the next revolution!

And yet, indie rock isn't set up to notice such efforts. The labels are too busy to learn who's out there, so artists must vie for attention by wasting time and energy instead on broken signals, like touring at a loss.

But BYCombo can fix this mess! We promise the labels that each band spends a solid chunk of lifetime on their demo; and we promise the bands that each label gives their demo fair consideration. So labels can know who's out there, and bands can focus on what matters.

### Who we're looking for

BYCombo is looking for anyone who wants to join a band and be part of the interdependence revolution! We're looking for you if you're one of the following:

* A creator with bold ideas for a project
* A rock musician— singer, guitarist, drummer
* A musician of another stripe— throatsinger, tabla player
* An artist of some other medium— dancer, web developer

You'll relocate with your band to Los Angeles or another major city. Once settled, you'll commit forty hours a week for three years to the making of an ambitious demo. Then when the demo is complete, you'll perform all the expected duties of a band member.

### What we'll do for you

BYCombo will put you in a band with other members of comparable talent, subject to everyone's approval. Through the years, we'll help you develop your band's project and provide you with a community of like-minded bands. The Bobtail Yearlings will also help wherever they can!

Once your demo is completed, we'll send it to participating labels. Afterward we'll post it on this website, making it discoverable to anyone looking for a disciplined band that made an ambitious 25,000-hour demo.
