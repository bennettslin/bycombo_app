**As a nonprofit, BYCombo offers amnesty to artists who pledge to advance the art form. Our approach is to assemble them into rock bands ourselves, and then expose them to interdependent-minded partners.**

Hi, I'm Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://bobtailyearlings.com)! You might be wondering why an amnesty program is needed in the arts— or why we favor interdependence, when *indie*-pendence is the dominant thinking today. Let me explain…

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock seeks to lower the barriers to entry for artists, and so it provides them with tools to forgo the major labels and build a fanbase on their own: social media, streaming services, crowdfunding platforms, and so forth.

Except… here's the problem: These tools only offer an advantage over other artists who *don't* use them— and today, most *do*. So there's no longer much benefit; from here on out, their main purpose is to punish any holdouts. But wait… this is how *rules* work! By encouraging artists to use these tools, indie rock has now made it the *rule* to do so!

And these tools *aren't* free; they cost time and energy that could be spent making art instead. So if you're a band trying to make the *best* art, you won't bother with them— leaving you *worse* off in this new Age of Empowerment! Yet in my experience, few others sympathize. Well, how about a truce?

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review.
`}

**Yes— since rules are made to be followed, bands who refuse to empower themselves can't complain about remaining unknown. But— breaking the rules is how history gets made! So let's not rule out amnesty either.**

### The outsider's dilemma

Here's the curious part: Ever notice that the best rappers *don't* worry about self-empowerment? It comes to them for free— if they just build up enough talents. For example, Eminem *didn't* have a fanbase when he was discovered by Dr. Dre; his self-released EP sold [all of 250 copies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slim_Shady_EP). Why does hip hop work so differently from indie rock?

It's simple: While indie rock was founded by *underdogs*, hip hop was founded by *outsiders*. What's the difference? The public doesn't root for outsiders. So as a minority myself, I'm drawn to hip hop's *inter*-dependent way of thinking. I'd rather be an "Eminem of rock" and have *partners* advocate for my band— while having these partners, in turn, depend on *us* to make the best art.

By *not* empowering myself, however, I'm dismissed as a hobbyist— and then my band isn't charitably supported as an indie artist would be. But charitable support is such a [winning advantage](/indie#charitable-support-starts-an-arms-race), no other artist can hope to compete. Which means a *label* can only compete by signing indie artists… who work hard *not* to need them. What a mess! And yet, the future is clear:

**As indie artists grow further empowered, labels will soon have no reason to exist— *unless* they get back to signing interdependent bands, who *do* need them… as it's the only way to make the best art!**

### Return of the rock martyrs

And that's the funny part: Rock *was* interdependent once! Well then, can't a band simply promise to make the best art, as before? Sadly, no. In a world of charitable support, all art is now *subjective*; talent predicts nothing. Which means an indie label's only trusted measure is the *objective* size of an artist's fanbase. Good grief… Can we fix this mess?

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review next three paragraphs.
`}

Yes! You see, indie rock has a glaring weakness: It doesn't *actually* select for the best artists. It picks "serious" artists over "casual" ones— in the faith that this amounts to the same thing. Yet, taken to its logical extreme, this would result in some of our *best* artists being classified as hobbyists! And here's how we'll prove it:

**Interdependent bands must sacrifice *all* their time and energy, for untold *years* of their lifetime, on a demo that *objectively* advances the art form— and which couldn't have been made with *any* less effort.**

But who'd sign up to be the first of these new rock martyrs? Why, a hungry outsider, that's who! As such, I spent 25,000 hours, or twelve full-time years, making [*Yearling's Bobtail*](https://yearlingsbobtail.com)— which includes coding and illustrating the audio webcomic. And of course, it was *only* by breaking indie rock's rules that I was able to do so. Surely, then, *someone* would grant me amnesty!

### Who makes the tastemakers?

Well… not so fast. The indie camp assumes that every artist faces the same hurdles— in which case, clearing the way for an underdog should still help the rest. Except… your hurdles as an outsider *aren't* the same. To compensate for *not* being the one they're rooting for, you need to try much harder, to be much better. But then… this makes *you* the underdog's biggest hurdle!

So even as you build up *objective* strengths to win over a skeptical public, the indie tastemakers assure victory for the underdog by keeping their criteria *subjective*. Which is why they favor music that *lacks* [enviable hooks](/indie#time-is-kind-to-craft-not-context), and why they refuse to acknowledge our human bias *against* [creative invention](/indie#creativity-gets-its-chance-from-the-clueless).

Suffice it to say, then… the indie labels rejected my demo. They also ignored later projects of mine that promised to *help* their underdogs: my songwriting book [*Bobtail Method*](https://bobtailmethod.com), and my musical tile game [*Bobtail Dominoes*](https://bobtaildominoes.com). So even *altruism* is a losing strategy for the outsider! And now I finally understood:

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Review.
`}

**A movement that's kind to the underdog *must* be cruel to the outsider. In other words, indie rock will *never* give amnesty to interdependent bands— because it *means* to shut them out!**

Worst of all, if the major labels are "bad guys," then this makes the indies "good guys." Well, who finally put the good guys in charge? Millennials! It's their greatest achievement, which they now protect at all costs. So anyone who questions their tastemakers is a bad guy as well— especially anyone from an [older generation](https://youtu.be/tODG4Xt45bU). And this gets at the heart of the problem:

**As the first rock movement to hold its ideals to be universal, indie rock is also the first to lock its rules in place. Which means there's no historical precedent to show us how to resist— or even to assure us that we *can*.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

If we can't resist, though— let's revolt! How? We… wait. See, indie rock has *another* glaring weakness: In judging an artist by the size of their fanbase, its tastemakers end up favoring *content*— namely, art that's optimized to gain fans in the *present*, at the cost of having none in the *future*. But content has little chance to make history… and to prove this, we just need time to pass.

// TODO: Revise next two paragraphs. Move idea of some artists being punished for having broken indie rock's rules to first paragraph, making it easier for second paragraph to begin with "Dr. Dres of rock."
`}

Sure enough, the last two decades of rock have had [little impact](https://today.yougov.com/entertainment/articles/36462-best-decade-for-music-americans-poll-data); even Gen Z mostly agrees! Which is the first step to reviving interdependence ourselves, since it's only once the *youth* are discontent that budding entrepreneurs and discerning curators will try to disrupt the market.

To those who've had to remain unknown for having broken indie rock's rules, these "Dr. Dres of rock" would love to give amnesty. But how, if they're unknown? Low barriers to entry have led to a hopelessly crowded field. The next step, then, is for [elitist gatekeepers](/indie#elitism-is-the-great-equalizer) like BYCombo to enforce a steep *cost* of entry. And here's our approach:

**To have a demo shown in our registry, each BYCombo band promises *not* to empower themselves. Instead, they'll earn a partner's trust by sacrificing a serious chunk of lifetime to advance the art form.**

So picture a *hundred* BYCombo bands, all of them committed to making the historically consequential works of our times. This is the *final* step to reviving interdependence— the next revolution in rock history!
