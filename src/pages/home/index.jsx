# "A thousand *Yearling's Bobtail*s"

// TODO: History in the making${'  '}
Hi, I'm Bennett. It took me 25,000 hours— twelve full-time years!— to make *Yearling's Bobtail*. Now imagine a thousand other bands putting the same time and energy into making their own ambitious demos. This would surely be the next history-making revolution that we're all waiting for!

Yet indie rock isn't set up to notice such efforts. Its gatekeepers are too harried to learn who's out there, so artists must vie for their attention by wasting time and energy instead on broken signals. Any artist who doesn't, we'll simply never be told about. And this gets to the heart of the problem:

**Once the gatekeepers begin to fail us, there's no way for us to know. Which means they'll be failing us for a long time— and maybe already have been.**

But BYCombo fixes this problem by giving ambitious bands a safety net. So even if their desire to make history puts them at odds with the gatekeepers, they'll still have a way to be found!

### Who we're looking for

BYCombo is open to anyone who wants to join a band and make history as part of the interdependence revolution! You should be one of the following:

* A creator with bold ideas for a musical project
* A rock musician— singer, guitarist, drummer…
* A musician of another stripe— cellist, tabla player…
* An artist of some other medium— novelist, web developer…

If we accept you, we'll put you in a band with three or four others of equal talent, subject to everyone's approval. You'll then relocate with your band to Los Angeles or another US city. Once the band project is decided, you'll each put enough time into it for the sum total to be 25,000 hours. With four bandmates, this works out to forty hours a week for three years.

### What we'll do for you

Through the years, BYCombo will advise you on your project and provide you with a community of similarly ambitious bands. The Bobtail Yearlings will also help when they can!

Once your demo is complete, we'll send it to any record labels or music industry insiders who sign up to hear it first. In exchange for this privilege, they'll promise to give it fair consideration and a timely response.

Afterward, we'll include it in our registry of demos. We'll establish that
