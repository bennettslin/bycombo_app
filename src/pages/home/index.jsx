# The BYCombo mission

// TODO: Add link for "Five vowels" to "historically consequential," both here and on the About page.
`}

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of self-sacrificing rock bands. We're here to launch the interdependence revolution, a movement devoted to bringing forth this century's most historically consequential rock music!**

Of course, *indie*-pendence is the dominant ideology in rock today. So why is *inter*-dependence needed as an alternative? Here's why…

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock roots for the underdog, which is why it's all about lowering the barriers to entry for artists. To do this, it provides them with tools to build a fanbase on their own: distribution services, streaming algorithms, social media analytics, and so forth.

These tools of empowerment aren't free, though— they cost the artist's time and energy. And yet, since they're available to *every* artist, they don't give a meaningful boost to those who use them; they merely set back anyone who *doesn't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Which is to say:

**By *expecting* artists to empower themselves, indie rock effectively *requires* them to do so. Each tool of empowerment then becomes yet another rule to follow.**

### A plea for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com/essays/ongoing/band-mission-and-principles). Let's be clear, the best artists *don't* waste time and energy on empowerment; it comes to them naturally, as a byproduct of building up their talents. So I'd rather not be *indie*-pendent at all! I want my band to be *inter*-dependent: to have a *label* help us build our fanbase— and, in turn, have this label depend on *us* to make the best art.

By *not* using indie rock's tools, however, I'm seen as lazy and incompetent— and then my band isn't charitably supported as an indie artist would be. But charitable support is such a winning advantage, no other artist can hope to compete unless they're indie as well. In turn, this means a label can only stay competitive by signing indie artists. So here's my dilemma:

**To make the best art, a band *must* be interdependent. This sets them back, however, since *every* artist today is assumed to follow indie rock's rules— and thus, to reap the benefits of using its tools.**

Now, rule makers and rule followers may see poetic justice here. Rules exist for a reason, after all, so rule breakers can't complain about being penalized. Yet breaking the rules is what it truly means to be creative! So let's not shut them out either.

### Return of the rock martyrs

The thing is, rock was interdependent once. But as trust eroded, each side took steps not to need the other. Indie artists now build a fanbase on their own, to show they can walk away from talks with a label. This leaves them with less time and energy to make art, of course— but their fans charitably support them to cover this weakness.

Well, then, can't an interdependent band just promise to make the best art instead? Sadly, no. In a world of charitable support, *all* art is subjective; and in a world of mutual distrust, *nothing* subjective can be a deciding factor. So, in turn, indie labels now judge an artist by the objective size of their fanbase, rather than on their talents. What a mess! This leaves only one solution:

**To revive interdependence, a band must spend *all* their time and energy— for untold *years* of their lifetime— on a demo that *objectively* advances the art form, and that couldn't have been made with *any* less effort.**

So rock is waiting for… a self-sacrificing martyr. But martyrs are the ones who make history! Which is why I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time years!— on [*Yearling's Bobtail*](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com). And, of course, it was by *not* building a fanbase that I was free to code and illustrate the audio webcomic. Because surely even the indie labels love it when a creative work *needs* to break the rules!

### Who curates the curators?

Well… not so fast. As barriers to entry are lowered, the applicant pool gets flooded, overwhelming the indie labels and other curators. This makes them insist all the more firmly that artists use indie rock's tools, which serve to keep every work bite-sized and uniform with others.

It's worse than just that, however. We see these indie curators as the "good guys" because they stay close to the underground scenes; they're one of *us*. So whatever they like, we trust that we'll like. But… according to studies, it's human nature to [*dislike* creativity](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/16/science/creativity-implicit-bias.html)!

Creative ideas are unfamiliar, and this makes us uncomfortable. Now, the corporate "bad guys" just ignore this discomfort, since it's *all* unfamiliar to them. But the good guys pride themselves on their hard-won instincts, so they interpret the discomfort as a sincere warning from their gut. Ironically, then, as [Frank Zappa noted](https://youtu.be/xP4wsURn3rw), this makes them *worse* at discovering creativity!

But worst of all, any band who breaks the good guys' rules is technically a bad guy as well— and indie rock came here to shut out *all* the bad guys! Which brings us to the heart of the problem:

**As the first rock movement to believe in the universality of its ideals, indie rock is also the first to lock its rules in place forever. So there's no historical precedent to teach us how to dissent— or even to assure us that we *can*.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

But if we can't dissent, then we'll just revolt! Some young people now *agree* with me that indie rock has made music worse, and this is the first step toward reviving interdependence from the outside: It tells the next David Geffen or Malcolm McLaren that the rock market is ripe for disruption.

So plenty out there would love to hear a demo that advances the art form— but how will they ever find it, given the endless stream pouring in through indie rock's low barriers to entry? The next step, then, is for an anti-indie counterculture to willfully *raise* its barriers. Well, BYCombo has great news!

**To stand out from the crowd, interdependent bands can now pay a steep *cost* of entry: Each band must sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime to have their demo shown in BYCombo's registry.**

Picture a *hundred* BYCombo bands, all of them breaking indie rock's rules to make the most disruptively creative works of our time. This will be the *final* step toward reviving interdependence— the next revolution in rock history!
