Hi! We're BYCombo, a nonprofit dedicated to launching a revolution of musical masterpieces.

Are you an unknown artist who's ready to craft a masterpiece? If you're willing to move to a major city and commit forty hours a week for as many years as it takes, then BYCombo is here for you.

We'll put you in a band with others as ambitious as you are, help you develop your big idea, provide you with a supportive community, and work with the gatekeepers to ensure your masterpiece is given fair consideration.

And BYCombo isn't just for musicians. We welcome anyone who hopes to challenge the accepted notion of who belongs in a band and what a band creates. Comic book artists, game developers, and all others, we'd love to hear from you!
