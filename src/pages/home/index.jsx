# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. Our mission is to launch the interdependence revolution, and to support the bands who'll make interdependence the most consequential rock movement of the century!**

### Tools… are *rules*

To lower the barriers to entry, indie rock provides artists with tools to build a fanbase without label support. These tools of empowerment aren't free: They cost the artist's time and energy. Yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them. So all they do is penalize those who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Which is to say:

**Once artists are *expected* to empower themselves, they're more or less *required* to do so. The indie culture then imposes these rules on *all* artists.**

### A call for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. It's obvious to me that the best artists *don't* waste time and energy on self-empowerment; it's just a byproduct of their worth. So I refuse to use indie rock's tools; I don't want to be indie at *all*. I want my band to be *interdependent*: to depend on a *label* to build our fanbase— and, in turn, have this label depend on *us* to make the best art. Which leads to my problem:

**An interdependent band trying to make the best art will be breaking the indie culture's rules, and penalized for it.**

How about a truce? Since rules are made to be followed, interdependent bands can't complain about being penalized. But breaking the rules is also how rock history gets made! So let's not shut them out either.

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

One penalty I faced early on, is that by refusing to put *any* time or energy into being indie, I was seen as lazy and inept. To counter this misunderstanding, I decided to pour *all* my time and energy into advancing the art form, with an ambitious demo that *couldn't* have been made for any less effort.

// TODO: Complete this section${'  '}
Which is how I came to spend 25,000 hours— twelve full-time *years*!— to make *Yearling's Bobtail*. Inventions like doublespeaker rhyme and the audio webcomic were partly motivated by my need to defend. It was just obvious to me that given enough effort, my strategy was guaranteed to succeed:

**Above a certain level, an interdependent band with no fanbase becomes more attractive to a competent label than an indie artist with an existing fanbase.**

Then, once the first interdependent band proves that this is a viable path, others will try to repeat this story. Picture a hundred bands, each with an ambitious demo that showcases an artistic innovation of their own. It would be the next revolution! Leading to:

**By breaking the rules, interdependent bands won't just be making the *disruptive* works of our time; their works will be this generation's most *accomplished* as well.**

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

So… what happened to this interdependence revolution?

// TODO: Connect that labels are gatekeepers?${'  '}
Unfortunately, as barriers to entry are lowered, indie labels grow harried; and harried labels have no patience for ambitious demos. Instead, every artist hoping for their consideration *must* follow the rules and use indie rock's tools. We'll just never hear about any who *don't*.

But worse, the very *concept* of interdependence can never take root, because no indie artist will *ever* concede that the best art comes from *not* being indie. If you aren't using indie rock's tools, then you don't exist— *end of story*. And all those who support them *must* embrace this view. This brings us to the heart of the problem:

**Once the indie culture fails us by shutting out the interdependent bands who would otherwise start the next revolution, we'll never know. Which means it'll be failing us for a long time— and likely already *has* been.**

### An anti-indie counterculture

The situation might seem hopeless, but there's good news: Some music fans would rather break the rules as well! They dispute indie rock's claim that it backs the underdog; after all, working-class minorities are the *least* eager to lower the barriers to entry. And how do indie artists who require charitable support stand *any* chance to make rock history, anyway?

// TODO: Flesh out${'  '}
These disgruntled fans are rock's last hope. They already have the *will* to challenge the indie gatekeepers. Now with BYCombo, they finally have the *way*.
