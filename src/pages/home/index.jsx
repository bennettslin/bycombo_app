# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. Our mission is to launch the interdependence revolution— the next movement in rock history!**

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock aims to lower the barriers to entry by providing artists with tools of empowerment. These tools aren't exactly free: They cost the artist's time and attention. And yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them. So all they do is penalize the ones who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! In other words:

**Every tool of empowerment is effectively just another *rule* to follow.**

### Calling for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. I find indie rock's rules absurd, and I refuse to follow them. Yet if everyone felt this way, then breaking the rules… would be the new rule! So I understand that my attitude hurts me alone, and why I get no sympathy for this. Still, rock history remembers the rule breakers and their disruptive works above all else— and I *will* be remembered! So how about a truce:

**Since rules are made to be followed, rule breakers can't complain about facing *natural* disadvantages. But since breaking the rules is how history gets made, let's not put up *systemic* barriers to shut them out either.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

So rather than complain, I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time *years*!— to make the music and webcomic for *Yearling's Bobtail*. And I have no regrets! Had I chosen to empower myself using indie rock's tools instead, an idea like doublespeaker rhyme never would have come to me. Which qualifies me to make an observation:

**To overcome their disadvantages, today's rule breakers have only one option: Sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime to make consequential art. This means the most *disruptive* works of our time… will also be the most *accomplished*.**

A rule breaker today can be both the next Sex Pistols *and* the next Steely Dan! So picture a hundred bands, each hoping to make history with an ambitious demo of their own. It would be the next revolution!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

And yet… indie rock isn't set up to care. When barriers to entry are lowered, gatekeepers become harried; and harried gatekeepers have no patience for ambitious demos. Instead, every artist hoping for their consideration *must* follow the rules by using their tools. We'll simply never hear about any who *don't*. And this is the heart of the problem:

**Once the gatekeepers fail us by shutting out the rule breakers, there's no way for us to know. Which means they'll be failing us for a long time— and likely already *have been*.**

### A nation of gadflies

The situation might seem hopeless. Luckily, there are rule breakers among music fans as well! They're the ones who refuse to be gaslit when indie rock insists that rock has never been better. Artists should be filling us with awe, not asking for support! Today's rock just doesn't seem destined for historical consequence, and this tells them that something is very wrong.

Intuitively recognize that today's rule breakers are making ambitious demos.

These disgruntled music fans are rock's last hope. They already have the *will* to challenge the indie gatekeepers. Now with BYCombo, they finally have the *way*.
