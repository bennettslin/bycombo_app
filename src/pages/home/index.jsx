**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of self-sacrificing rock bands. We're here to launch the interdependence revolution, a movement devoted to bringing forth this century's most historically consequential rock music!**

Of course, *indie*-pendence is the dominant ideology in rock today. So why is *inter*-dependence needed as an alternative? Here's why…

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock roots for the underdog— which is why it's all about lowering the barriers to entry for artists. To do this, it provides them with tools to bypass the labels and build a fanbase on their own: distribution services, streaming algorithms, social media analytics, and so forth.

These tools of empowerment aren't free, though— they cost the artist's time and energy. And yet, since they're available to *every* artist, they don't give a meaningful boost to those who use them; they mostly penalize anyone who *doesn't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Which is to say:

**By *expecting* artists to empower themselves, indie rock effectively *requires* them to do so. As such, each tool of empowerment becomes yet another rule to follow.**

So indie rock's tools… are now *rules*. And since rules are made to be followed, rule breakers can't complain about being penalized. But breaking the rules is also how history gets made! So let's not shut them out, either.

### A minority's dilemma

Hi, I'm Bennett from the [Bobtail Yearlings](https://www.bobtailyearlings.com/essays/ongoing/band-mission-and-principles). Ever notice that hip hop— a movement *founded* by underdogs— works very differently from indie rock? The best rappers *don't* worry about empowerment; they know it comes for free if they build up their talents. For example, Eminem didn't have a real fanbase before he was signed by Dr. Dre; his EP sold [only 250 copies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slim_Shady_EP).

As a minority myself, I find hip hop's way of thinking far more sensible. So I want my band to be interdependent as well: to have a *label* help us build our fanbase— and, in turn, have this label depend on *us* to make the best art.

By *not* spending time and energy using indie rock's tools, however, I'm seen as a hobbyist— and then my band isn't charitably supported as an indie artist would be. But charitable support is such a winning advantage, no other artist can hope to compete unless they're indie as well. In turn, labels can only stay competitive by signing indie artists! And yet their fate is clear:

**As indie artists grow further empowered, the very *purpose* of labels will gradually cease to exist— *unless* they get back to signing interdependent bands… who make the best art in the first place!**

### Return of the rock martyrs

And that's the funny part: Rock *was* interdependent once! Well, then, can't a band simply promise to make the best art, like before? Sadly, no. In a world of charitable support, *all* art is now subjective, so talents no longer predict anything. This means an indie label's *only* trusted measure is the objective size of an artist's fanbase. What a mess!

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Another paragraph on logical extremes and hobbyist. This leaves one solution. Mention saving rock.
`}

But there's good news: The public clearly wants.
Absurdity of logical extremes.
Hobbyists make the best art. And so we arrive at the perfect solution:

**To revive interdependence, a band must spend *all* their time and energy— for untold *years* of their lifetime— on a demo that *objectively* advances the art form, and couldn't have been made with *any* less effort.**

So rock is waiting for… a self-sacrificing martyr. But martyrs are the ones who make history! Which is why I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time years!— on [*Yearling's Bobtail*](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com). And, of course, it was by *not* building a fanbase that I was free to code and illustrate the audio webcomic. Because surely even indie labels love it when a creative work *needs* to break the rules!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

Well… not so fast. As barriers to entry are lowered, the applicant pool gets flooded, overwhelming the indie labels and other gatekeepers. This makes them insist all the more firmly that artists use indie rock's tools, which serve to keep every work bite-sized and uniform.

But it's worse than just that. To demand fair compensation, indie artists have only one bargaining chip: their collective power to hold *back* the art form. Which means indie rock stands *opposed* to simply letting the art form advance at any cost! And this explains why its gatekeepers *weren't* happy to see me: I was like a scab crossing the picket line during a union strike!

Worst of all, if the major labels are "bad guys," then the indie labels are "good guys." Well, who *finally* put the good guys in charge? Millennials! It's their greatest achievement, which they now protect at all costs. So anyone who questions their gatekeepers— especially anyone from an older generation— is a [bad guy as well](https://youtu.be/tODG4Xt45bU)! And this is the heart of the problem:

**As the first rock movement to believe its ideals to be universal, indie rock is also the first to lock down its rules for good. As such, there's no historical precedent to show us how to dissent— or even to assure us that we *can*.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

But if we can't dissent… then let's revolt! By some miracle, Gen Z sides with the *older* generations; *they* want rock bands to make the best art again as well! And their discontent is the first step toward reviving interdependence from the *outside*: It tells the next David Geffen or Malcolm McLaren that the rock market is ripe for disruption.

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Best way to phrase this?
`}

These "bad guys" would love to hear a demo that might save rock— but how would they ever find it, given the endless stream pouring in through indie rock's low barriers to entry? The next step, then, is for an alternative source to willfully *raise* its barriers. Well, BYCombo has great news!

**To earn the listener's trust, interdependent bands can now pay a steep *cost* of entry: To have their demo shown in BYCombo's public registry, each band must sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime to advance the art form.**

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Obviously. Proving that the best art comes from *not* using indie rock's tools.
`}

Picture a hundred BYCombo bands, each one doing what I did, and thereby proving that the disruptively creative works of our times will only ever be made by breaking indie rock's rules. This will be the *final* step toward reviving interdependence— the next revolution in rock history!
