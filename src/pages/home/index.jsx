# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. Our mission is to launch the interdependence revolution, and to support the bands who'll make interdependence the most consequential rock movement of the century!**

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock wants to lower the barriers to entry by providing artists with tools of empowerment. These tools aren't actually free: They cost the artist's time and energy. And yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them. So all they do is penalize the ones who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Which is to say:

**An indie culture that helps artists to empower themselves will end up imposing rules that *every* artist must follow.**

### Calling for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. It seems obvious to me that the best artists *don't* waste time and energy on self-empowerment; it just comes to them as a byproduct of their worth. And so I refuse to use indie rock's tools. I want my band to be *interdependent*— to depend on a record label that, in turn, depends on *us* to rank among the best. But think of what this means:

**Once the indie culture takes over, any interdependent band who aims to rank among the best… will be breaking the rules to do so.**

Now, if most others were like me, then breaking the rules… would just be the new rule! So I understand that my attitude hurts me alone, and why I get no sympathy for it. But at the same time, everyone *else* understands that rule breakers are the ones who make rock history! So how about a truce:

**Since rules are made to be followed, rule breakers shouldn't complain that they face disadvantages. But breaking the rules is also how history gets made, so let's not shut them out either.**

### A thousand *Yearling's Bobtail*s

One disadvantage is that when an interdependent band refuses to put *any* time or energy into self-empowerment, they're seen as lazy and inept. To counter this misreading, their only option is to pour *all* their time and energy into advancing the art form, with an ambitious demo that *couldn't* have been made for any less effort. But think of what this tells us:

**By breaking the rules, interdependent bands won't just be making the *disruptive* works of our time; theirs will be our most *accomplished* as well.**

In other words, the next Sex Pistols… can also be the next Steely Dan! This is why I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time *years*!— to make the music and webcomic for *Yearling's Bobtail*. But who *wouldn't* want to rebel by making art nonstop? Picture a thousand bands, each with an ambitious demo of their own. It would be the next revolution!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

Well… not so fast. When barriers to entry are lowered, gatekeepers become harried; and harried gatekeepers have no patience for ambitious demos. Instead, every artist hoping for their consideration *must* do exactly as they expect, and use their tools; we'll simply never hear about any who *don't*.

Furthermore, indie artists *can't* coexist with interdependent bands, whom they see as an existential threat. Once we give them power, they will create a system that can never allow for the possibility that an artist can be better by not being indie.

// TODO: Rethink${'  '}
**Once the indie culture fails us by shutting out the interdependent bands who would otherwise start the next revolution, there's no way for us to know. Which means it'll be failing us for a long time— and likely already *has* been.**

### An anti-indie counterculture

// TODO: All of this section${'  '}
The situation might seem hopeless. Luckily, some music fans *also* find indie rock's rules absurd, and would rather break them as well! They know that lowering barriers to entry only raises them elsewhere. And they want to be *awestruck* by artists, not to *support* them. Today's rock just doesn't seem destined to make history, which tells them that something is very wrong.

These disgruntled music fans are rock's last hope. They already have the *will* to challenge the indie gatekeepers. Now with BYCombo, they finally have the *way*.
