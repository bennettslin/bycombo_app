# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. Our mission is to assemble interdependent bands committed to making historically consequential demos, and to be a public registry of this work.**

### Tools… are rules

Indie rock is all about providing artists with tools of empowerment. These tools require commitment— yet they offer no advantage, since *every* artist is expected to use them. Instead, they simply punish those who *don't*… But this is how rules work! Indie rock's *tools*, in other words, are just more *rules*.

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

Hi, I'm Bennett. I *hate* rules— but if everyone felt the same, then breaking rules would be the rule! So I get why my attitude puts me at a disadvantage, which then has to be overcome in other ways. This is why I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time years!— to make the album and audio webcomic for *Yearling's Bobtail*.

Now, rule breakers like me aren't common, but we're also not rare! Imagine a hundred other bands working just as hard to make an ambitious demo of their own. It would be the next revolution in rock history!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

And yet… indie rock won't notice these efforts. The indie gatekeepers are too harried to learn who's out there, so the only artists they'll look into are the ones working hard to follow the rules instead. Any artist who *isn't*— they'll simply never tell us about. And this is the heart of the problem:

**Once the gatekeepers fail us, there's no way for us to know. Which means they'll be failing us for a long time— if they haven't been *already*.**

But through BYCombo's demo registry, the public will finally know what the indie gatekeepers *aren't* showing them! Anyone can now learn about the latest bands breaking the rules to make history, whose ambitious works necessarily risk being overlooked by the gatekeepers.

### Who we're looking for

BYCombo is open to any artist who's ready to join the interdependence revolution— the next movement in history after indie rock! You're also one of the following:

* A rock musician— singer, guitarist, drummer…
* A musician of another stripe— cellist, tabla player…
* An artist of some other medium— dancer, web developer…
* A creator with a bold vision for a musical project

We'll put you in a band with three or four others of equal talent, subject to everyone's approval. You'll then relocate with your band to Los Angeles or another US city. Once the band project is decided, you'll each put in enough time for the sum total to be at least 25,000 hours. With four bandmates, this works out to forty hours a week for three years.

### What we'll do for you

Through the years, BYCombo will advise you on your project and include you in a supportive community of other ambitious bands. The Bobtail Yearlings will also help when they can!

Once your demo is complete, we'll send it to any record labels or music industry insiders who sign up to hear it first. In exchange for this privilege, they'll promise to give it fair consideration and a timely response.

Finally, we'll add your demo to our public registry. With your help, BYCombo will become the public's trusted source to hear about all the latest bands sacrificing a chunk of their lifetime to make history!
