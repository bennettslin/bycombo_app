# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. We're here to launch the interdependence revolution— the next movement in rock history!**

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock loves to provide artists with tools of empowerment. These tools require the artist's time and commitment— and yet they offer no advantage over others, since *every* artist is expected to use them. Instead, they simply penalize the few who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! In other words:

**Every tool of empowerment is just one more *rule* to follow.**

### Calling for a truce

// TODO: Rephrase${'  '}
Hi, I'm Bennett. Personally, I *hate* rules— yet if everyone felt the same, then breaking the rules would be the new rule! So I get why my attitude hurts me and me alone. But… I'm going to break them anyway. Rock history mainly remembers the rule breakers, and I *will* be remembered! So here's a truce:

**Since rules are made to be followed, rule breakers can't complain about facing a *natural* disadvantage. But since breaking the rules is also how history gets made, let's not impose *systemic* barriers on them as well.**

### A thousand *Yearling's Bobtail*s

So how did *I* choose to overcome my natural disadvantage? Given all the time I saved by *not* using indie rock's tools, I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time *years*!— to make the music and webcomic for *Yearling's Bobtail*.

Now, rule breakers like me aren't common— but we're also not rare! Picture a thousand other bands, each sacrificing a serious chunk of lifetime to advance the art form with a demo of their own. It would be the next revolution!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

And yet… I can say from experience that indie rock won't notice such efforts. The indie gatekeepers are too harried to learn who's out there, so the only artists they ever consider are the ones who follow the rules. Any artist who *doesn't*— they'll simply never tell us about. And this is the heart of the problem:

**Once the gatekeepers fail us, there's no way for us to know. Which means they'll be failing us for a long time— if they haven't been *already*.**

// TODO: Confirm wording${'  '}
In other words, indie rock has violated our truce, and now these systemic barriers are insurmountable. To be fair, breaking the rules now requires *more* effort, not less, and this is a recent change. So maybe the gatekeepers don't realize that they're shutting out the rule breakers, because they still expect them to come from the opposite extreme!

// TODO: Finalize heading${'  '}
### Artistic gadfly

// TODO: Flesh out${'  '}
Luckily, there are rule breakers among music fans as well, who recognize that they're no longer seeing their own on the artist side.
Who intuitively understand that these days, the *spirit* of the Sex Pistols won't be found in any band that *sounds* like them; that it's far more likely to be found in a band like the Bobtail Yearlings.

who aren't content to accept whatever the gatekeepers tell them, and are pretty sure that what they're being shown isn't all there is.

But with BYCombo, the public can now discover any bands breaking the rules to make history, who risk being ignored by the indie gatekeepers!

### Who we're looking for

BYCombo is open to any artist eager to sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime for the interdependence revolution! You're also one of the following:

* A rock musician— singer, guitarist, drummer…
* A musician of another stripe— cellist, tabla player…
* An artist of some other medium— dancer, web developer…
* A creator with a bold vision for a musical project

Once we put you in a band with three or four others— subject to everyone's approval— you'll all relocate to Los Angeles or another major city. Each of you will then put in enough time on your band project for the sum total to be 25,000 hours.

### What we'll do for you

Through the years, BYCombo will advise you on your band project. If the project requires unique collaborators— acrobats? puppeteers?— we'll help you find them. We'll also include you in a supportive community of other ambitious bands. And finally, the Bobtail Yearlings will help when they can!

// TODO: Include writers and gadflies${'  '}
Once your demo is complete, we'll send it to any record labels or industry insiders who sign up to hear it first. In exchange for this privilege, they'll promise to give it fair consideration and a timely response.

Finally, we'll add your demo to our public registry. With your help, BYCombo will become the public's trusted resource to hear about all the latest bands sacrificing serious chunks of lifetime to make history!
