# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. Our mission is to launch the interdependence revolution, and to support the bands who'll build it into the most consequential rock movement of the 21st century!**

### Tools… are *rules*

To lower the barriers to entry, indie rock provides artists with tools to build a fanbase without label support. These tools of empowerment aren't free: They cost the artist's time and energy. Yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them. So all they do is penalize those who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Which is to say:

**Once artists are *expected* to empower themselves, they're effectively *required* to do so. The indie culture then imposes these rules on *all* artists.**

### A call for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. Let's face it, the best artists *don't* waste time and energy on self-empowerment; it's just a byproduct of their worth. So I refuse to use indie rock's tools; I'd rather not be *indie*-pendent at all. I want my band to be *inter*-dependent: to depend on a *label* to build our fanbase— and, in turn, have this label depend on *us* to make the best art. But here's my problem:

**An interdependent band committed to making the best art will need to break the indie culture's rules, for which they'll be penalized.**

So how about a truce? Since rules are made to be followed, interdependent bands can't complain about being penalized. But breaking the rules is also how rock history gets made! So let's not shut them out either.

### Return of the rock martyrs

One penalty I faced early on is that by refusing to put *any* time or energy into being indie, I was seen as arrogant and lazy. To correct this misjudgment, I needed to pour *all* my time and energy into advancing the art form, with an ambitious demo that *couldn't* have been made for any less effort.

So I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time *years*!— to make *Yearling's Bobtail*. And by *not* building a fanbase, I was free to invent doublespeaker rhyme and create the audio webcomic. After all, if my band can just make the *best* art, then some label will want to *help* us build a fanbase.

The fact is, rock was *once* interdependent. The concept is solid; we just need to see it proven once more. It's not hard to understand how we lost it. It requires trusting a partner. Once that trust breaks down, and we learn to do their job for ourselves, we lose the will and the way to regain interdependence.

**Interdependence can only be regained by bands sacrificing serious chunks of lifetime, while given no guarantee that our misjudgment of their intentions will ever be corrected.**

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

Well… not so fast. As barriers to entry are lowered, the indie gatekeepers grow harried. And so artists *must* use indie rock's tools, which serve to keep their works bite-sized and uniform with others. This means the gatekeepers won't ever bother with an ambitious demo made by a band who clearly didn't follow the rules.

Even worse, the concept of interdependence *itself* can never take root, since no indie artist will ever concede that the best art comes from *not* being indie. As they see it, building a fanbase is what proved *their* worth, which makes it the true measure of *every* artist. And this is the heart of the matter:

**As the indie culture grows attached to its rules, it loses both the will *and* the way to regain interdependence. Interdependent bands will then be shut out for good— and we'll just never know.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

The situation might seem hopeless, but there's good news: Some music fans would rather break the rules as well! They dispute the claim that indie rock backs the underdog, since working-class minorities are the *least* eager to lower the barriers to entry. And how do indie artists who require charitable support stand *any* chance to make rock history, anyway?

// TODO: These music fans will have no trouble embracing interdependence because… so they just need to know about the bands trying to bring it back.

The fact is, rock was *once* interdependent, and hip hop has never *not* been. The concept is solid; rock just needs to see it proven once more. And I can't be the only one who gets this. Picture a hundred bands, each advancing the art form with an ambitious demo of their own! The world would soon realize:

**By breaking the indie culture's rules, interdependent bands will be making the most disruptive *and* most accomplished works of our time. *This* is the next revolution we're all waiting for!**
