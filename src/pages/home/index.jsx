# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. We're here to launch the interdependence revolution that will bring forth the most consequential rock bands of the 21st century!**

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock loves to back the underdog, which is why it's all about lowering the barriers to entry. To do this, it provides tools that any artist can use to build a fanbase without label support.

These tools of empowerment aren't free, though: They cost the artist's time and energy. And yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them. All they do is penalize those who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Which is to say:

**By *expecting* artists to empower themselves, the indie culture effectively *requires* them to do so. It then imposes its rules on *all* artists.**

### A call for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. Let's face it, the best artists *don't* waste time and energy on self-empowerment; it comes as a byproduct of their worth. So I refuse to use indie rock's tools; I'd rather not be *indie*-pendent at all. I want my band to be *inter*-dependent: to depend on a *label* to build our fanbase— and, in turn, have this label depend on *us* to make the best art.

// TODO: Mention being misjudged, lack of sympathy.${'  '}
Not building a fanbase, however, marks my band ineligible for charitable support, which is needed to get ahead in indie rock. So this is my dilemma:

**An interdependent band committed to making the best art will need to break the indie culture's rules, for which they'll face penalties.**

But how about a truce? Since rules are made to be followed, interdependent bands can't complain about being penalized. And yet breaking the rules is how rock history gets made! So let's not shut them out either.

### Return of the rock martyrs

// TODO: Ideas are good now, just need rewording.${'  '}
The crazy thing is, *every* band was interdependent once! How did indie rock become the unfortunate reality? Quite simply, interdependence requires trust between bands and labels. Once that trust is broken, each side does what it can not to need the other. So how can a band rebuild trust?

It might seem obvious to do what worked in the past. Instead of gaining leverage by *not* needing a label, a band can become good enough that *other* labels should want them. But these days, every label will still insist that a band set aside *some* time and energy to build a fanbase— which defeats the very reason to seek out a label! And so there's only one solution:

**To regain interdependence, a band must sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime, during which *all* their time and energy is spent on an ambitious demo that *couldn't* have been made for any less effort.**

In other words, interdependence is waiting for… a rock martyr. And martyrs are the ones who make rock history! So this is why I spent 25,000 hours— that's twelve full-time *years*!— on [*Yearling's Bobtail*](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com). And by *not* building a fanbase, I was able to invent doublespeaker rhyme and create the audio webcomic. What label *wouldn't* be happy with this tradeoff?

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

Well… not so fast. As barriers to entry are lowered, the indie gatekeepers grow harried. So artists *must* use indie rock's tools, which serve to keep works bite-sized and uniform with all others. This means the gatekeepers won't ever bother with an ambitious demo from a band who clearly didn't follow the rules.

But worse, the concept of interdependence *itself* has no way to take root. Once an indie artist works hard to build a fanbase on their own, they'll never concede that the best art comes from *not* doing so. And why should they be gracious to any band promising a revolution that would hurt their standing? This leads to the heart of the problem:

**The indie culture *doesn't* see its rules as an unfortunate necessity; to the contrary, they're its celebrated *purpose*. As such, it will shut out every band trying to regain interdependence— and we'll never hear about it.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

The situation might seem hopeless, but there's good news: Some music fans would rather break the rules as well! They dispute the claim that indie rock backs the underdog, since working-class minorities are the *least* eager to lower the barriers to entry. And how do indie artists who require charitable support stand *any* chance to make rock history, anyway?

// TODO: Final${'  '}
These music fans will have no trouble embracing interdependence because… so they just need to know about the bands trying to bring it back.

The fact is, rock was *once* interdependent, and hip hop has never *not* been. The concept is solid; rock just needs to see it proven once more. And I can't be the only one who gets this. Picture a hundred bands, each advancing the art form with an ambitious demo of their own! The world would then see:

**By breaking the indie culture's rules, interdependent bands will be making the most disruptive *and* most accomplished works of our time. *This* is the next revolution in rock history!**
