# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. Our mission is to assemble interdependent bands committed to making historically consequential demos, and to be a public registry of this work.**

### A thousand *Yearling's Bobtail*s

Hi, I'm Bennett. It took me 25,000 hours— twelve full-time years!— to make the album and audio webcomic for *Yearling's Bobtail*. Imagine a thousand other bands putting the same time and energy into an ambitious demo of their own. This would be the next revolution remembered by history!

Yet indie rock isn't set up to notice such efforts. Its gatekeepers are too harried to learn who's out there, so artists must vie for their attention by wasting time and energy instead on broken signals, like touring at a loss. Any artist who *doesn't*— the gatekeepers will simply never tell us about.

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

And this is the heart of the problem:

**Once the gatekeepers start to fail us, there's no way for us to know. Which means they'll be failing us for a long time— if they haven't been *already*.**

But through BYCombo's demo registry, the public will finally know what the indie gatekeepers *aren't* showing them! Anyone can now learn about the latest bands trying to make history, whose ambitious works necessarily risk being overlooked by the gatekeepers.

### Who we're looking for

BYCombo is open to any artist who's ready to sacrifice a chunk of their lifetime to join the interdependence revolution— the next movement in history after indie rock! You're also one of the following:

* A rock musician— singer, guitarist, drummer…
* A musician of another stripe— cellist, tabla player…
* An artist of some other medium— dancer, web developer…
* An entrepreneur with a bold vision for a musical project

We'll put you in a band with three or four others of equal talent, subject to everyone's approval. You'll then relocate with your band to Los Angeles or another US city. Once the band project is decided, you'll each put in enough time for the sum total to be at least 25,000 hours. With four bandmates, this works out to forty hours a week for three years.

### What we'll do for you

Through the years, BYCombo will advise you on your project and include you in a supportive community of other ambitious bands. The Bobtail Yearlings will also help when they can!

Once your demo is complete, we'll send it to any record labels or music industry insiders who sign up to hear it first. In exchange for this privilege, they'll promise to give it fair consideration and a timely response.

Finally, we'll add your demo to our public registry. With your help, BYCombo will become the public's trusted source to hear about the latest bands who've sacrificed a chunk of their lifetime to make history!
