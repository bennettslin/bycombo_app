# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. We're here to launch the interdependence revolution that will bring forth the most consequential rock bands of the 21st century!**

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock loves to back the underdog, which is why it's all about lowering the barriers to entry. To do this, it provides tools that any artist can use to build a fanbase without label support.

These tools of empowerment aren't free, though: They cost the artist's time and energy. And yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them; all they do is penalize those who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Which is to say:

**By *expecting* artists to empower themselves, indie rock effectively *requires* them to do so. It then imposes its rules on *all* artists.**

### A call for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. It's clear to me that the best artists *don't* waste time and energy on self-empowerment; it comes as a byproduct of their worth. So I refuse to use indie rock's tools; I'd rather not be *indie*-pendent at all. I want my band to be *inter*-dependent: to depend on a *label* to build our fanbase— and, in turn, have this label depend on *us* to make the best art.

By *not* building a fanbase, however, I'm seen as lazy and incompetent. And then my band isn't given the same charitable support that puts indie artists ahead— which effectively puts us *behind*. So this is my dilemma:

**In promising to make the best art, interdependent bands *need* to break indie rock's rules— for which they'll be penalized.**

But how about a truce? Since rules are made to be followed, interdependent bands can't complain about facing penalties. Yet breaking the rules is how rock history gets made! So let's not shut them out either.

### Return of the rock martyrs

The funny thing is, rock was interdependent once. But as trust broke down, each side took unfortunate yet necessary steps not to need the other. So now, indie artists build a fanbase to show they can walk away from talks with a label. And labels, in turn, just bet on this fanbase instead of the artist's future potential. What a mess! How does an interdependent band fix it?

Sadly, it's no longer enough for them to promise the best art. In a world of charitable support, all art is subjective; and in a world of mutual distrust, nothing subjective can be a deciding factor. So indie artists are just *assumed* to make the best art possible, which frees up their time and energy to build the fanbase that labels *really* decide on. This leaves only one solution:

**To regain rock's interdependence, a band must spend *all* their time and energy— for untold *years* of their lifetime— on a demo that *objectively* advances the art form and couldn't have been made for *any* less effort.**

In other words, interdependence is waiting for… a rock martyr. But martyrs are the ones who make history! And so I spent 25,000 hours— that's *twelve* full-time years!— on [*Yearling's Bobtail*](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com). And by *not* building a fanbase, I was able to invent [doublespeaker rhyme](https://www.yearlingsbobtail.com/4-odin/?annotation=7) and create the audio webcomic. What label *wouldn't* be happy with this tradeoff?

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

Well… not so fast. As barriers to entry are lowered, the indie gatekeepers grow harried. So artists are *required* to use indie rock's tools, which serve to keep their works bite-sized and uniform with all others. This means the gatekeepers won't *ever* bother with an ambitious demo from a band who clearly didn't follow the rules.

But worse, the concept of interdependence *itself* has no way to take root. Once an indie artist puts time and energy into building a fanbase, they'll never agree that the best art comes from *not* doing so. And having paid their dues, they're now loyal to a status quo in which *every* artist has to struggle as inefficiently as *they* did. Which leads to the heart of the problem:

**Indie rock *doesn't* see its rules as an unfortunate necessity; to the contrary, they're its celebrated *purpose*. As such, it will shut out any band trying to regain rock's interdependence— and we'll never hear about it.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

The situation might seem hopeless. But don't fret: Some music fans would rather break the rules as well! They dispute the claim that indie rock backs the underdog, since working-class minorities are the *least* eager to lower the barriers to entry. And how do indie artists who rely on charitable support stand *any* chance to make rock history, anyway?

${'  ' || `
// TODO: Final.
`}

These fans know their rock history. And so they grasp that the best art comes from interdependence. And so do some industry insiders— hip hop, for example, has never *not* been interdependent. Meanwhile, how many bands would love to have a label build their fanbase, in exchange for promising to make the best art? So here's the great news:

BYCombo promotes interdependence by allowing bands to win over music fans and industry insiders directly who want to regain interdependence for rock to connect.

Picture a hundred bands, each advancing the art form with an ambitious demo of their own. In breaking indie rock's rules, they're already making the *disruptive* works of our time. But to regain rock's interdependence, they'll also be making our most *accomplished* works. *This* is the next revolution in rock history that we're all waiting for!
