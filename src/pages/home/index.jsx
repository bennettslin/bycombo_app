# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. Our mission is to launch the interdependence revolution, and to support the bands who'll make interdependence the most consequential rock movement of the century!**

### Tools… are *rules*

Indie rock wants to lower the barriers to entry by providing artists with tools of empowerment. These tools aren't actually free: They cost the artist's time and energy. And yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them. So all they do is punish the ones who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Indie rock's tools are just more *rules*. All of which is to say:

**An indie culture that wants artists to empower themselves will end up imposing rules that *every* artist must follow.**

### A call for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. It's obvious to me that the best artists *don't* waste time and energy on self-empowerment; it's simply a byproduct of their worth. So I refuse to use indie rock's tools; I don't want to be indie at *all*. I want my band to be *interdependent*: to depend on a record label that tries to be the best— and, in turn, depends on *us* to do the same. Which leads to my problem:

**Once the indie culture takes over, any interdependent band who tries to be the best… will be breaking the rules to do so.**

How about a truce, though? Since rules are made to be followed, those who break them shouldn't complain about being punished. But at the same time, *everyone* knows that breaking the rules is how history gets made! So let's not shut out the rule breakers either.

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

Because interdependent bands refuse to put *any* time or energy into using indie rock's tools, they get punished for being lazy and inept. But again, no complaints! To correct this misreading, their only option is to pour *all* their time and energy into advancing the art form, with an ambitious demo that *couldn't* have been made for any less effort. Yet think of what this means:

**By breaking the rules, interdependent bands won't just be making the *disruptive* works of our time; their works will be this generation's most *accomplished* as well.**

Which is why I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time *years*!— to make the music and webcomic for *Yearling's Bobtail*. And yes: Had I been focused on self-empowerment, I *couldn't* have invented doublespeaker rhyme.

But it should be obvious to *anyone* that interdependence leads to better art. So picture a hundred bands, each with an ambitious demo that showcases an artistic innovation of their own. It would be the next revolution!

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

Well… not so fast. As barriers to entry are lowered, indie rock's gatekeepers grow harried; and harried gatekeepers have no patience for ambitious demos. Instead, every artist hoping for their consideration *must* follow the rules and use their tools. We'll just never hear about any who *don't*.

But worse, the very *concept* of interdependence can never take root, because indie artists will *never* concede that the best art comes from *not* being indie. The way they see it, if you aren't using indie rock's tools, then you're lazy or inept— *end of story*. And everyone who supports them *must* embrace this view as well. This brings us to the heart of the problem:

**Once the indie culture fails us by shutting out the interdependent bands who would otherwise start the next revolution, we'll never know. Which means it'll be failing us for a long time— and likely already *has* been.**

### An anti-indie counterculture

The situation might seem hopeless, but there's good news: Some music fans would rather break the rules as well! They dispute indie rock's claim that it backs the underdog; after all, working-class minorities are the *least* eager to lower the barriers to entry. And how do indie artists who require charitable support stand *any* chance to make history, anyway?

// TODO: Flesh out${'  '}
These disgruntled fans are rock's last hope. They already have the *will* to challenge the indie gatekeepers. Now with BYCombo, they finally have the *way*.
