# The BYCombo mission

**BYCombo is a nonprofit incubator of rock bands. We're here to launch the interdependence revolution that will bring forth the most consequential rock bands of the 21st century!**

### Tools… are *rules*

// TODO: Flesh out.${'  '}
Indie rock wants to lower the barriers to entry, and so it provides artists with tools to build a fanbase without label support.

These tools of empowerment aren't free, though: They cost the artist's time and energy. And yet they offer no advantage in the end, since *every* artist is expected to use them. All they do is penalize those who *don't*. But… this is how *rules* work! Which is to say:

**By *expecting* artists to empower themselves, the indie culture effectively *requires* them to do so. It then imposes its rules on *all* artists.**

### Calling for a truce

Hi, I'm Bennett. Let's face it, the best artists *don't* waste time and energy on self-empowerment; it's just a byproduct of their worth. So I refuse to use indie rock's tools; I'd rather not be *indie*-pendent at all. I want my band to be *inter*-dependent: to depend on a *label* to build our fanbase— and, in turn, have this label depend on *us* to make the best art.

Not being indie, however, marks my band ineligible for the charitable support that other artists get. And this is my dilemma:

**An interdependent band committed to making the best art will need to break the indie culture's rules, for which they'll face penalties.**

How about a truce? Since rules are made to be followed, interdependent bands can't complain when they're penalized. But breaking the rules is also how rock history gets made! So let's not shut them out either.

### Return of the rock martyrs

// TODO: Start with this paragraph.${'  '}
This way of thinking isn't new to rock; we just lost it. Interdependence requires trust between partners, so it's really hard to regain once that trust is broken. Each side digs in further not to need the other.

// TODO: Think about. This is a burden faced by every interdependent band.${'  '}
Another penalty I faced early on is that by not putting *any* time or energy into building a fanbase, I was treated as lazy and incompetent. To counter this misjudgment, then, I needed to pour *all* my time and energy into advancing the art form, with an ambitious demo that *couldn't* have been made for any less effort.

// TODO: Use the above sentence.${'  '}
**To regain interdependence for *everyone*, a band must sacrifice a serious chunk of lifetime to make the best art, all the while shouldering the entire burden and having their intentions misjudged.**

// TODO: Wording.${'  '}
In other words, rock is waiting on… a martyr. So I spent 25,000 hours— twelve full-time *years*!— to make *Yearling's Bobtail*. And by *not* building a fanbase, I was able to invent doublespeaker rhyme and the audio webcomic. I just assumed this would be all that I needed. Because surely we haven't lost the *will* to regain interdependence?

### Who gatekeeps the gatekeepers?

Well… not so fast. As barriers to entry are lowered, the indie gatekeepers grow harried. So artists *must* use indie rock's tools, which serve to keep works bite-sized and uniform with all others. This means the gatekeepers won't ever bother with an ambitious demo from a band who clearly didn't follow the rules.

// TODO: Include how they speak for the underdog${'  '}
But worse, the concept of interdependence *itself* can never take root, since no indie artist will ever concede that the best art comes from *not* being indie. As they see it, building a fanbase is what proved *their* worth, which makes it the true measure of *every* artist. So this is the heart of the problem:

// TODO: Reword?${'  '}
**The indie culture actively *opposes* interdependence. Which means it'll always fail us by shutting out any interdependent bands— and we'll just never know.**

### A hundred *Yearling's Bobtail*s

The situation might seem hopeless, but there's good news: Some music fans would rather break the rules as well! They dispute the claim that indie rock backs the underdog, since working-class minorities are the *least* eager to lower the barriers to entry. And how do indie artists who require charitable support stand *any* chance to make rock history, anyway?

// TODO: Final${'  '}
These music fans will have no trouble embracing interdependence because… so they just need to know about the bands trying to bring it back.

The fact is, rock was *once* interdependent, and hip hop has never *not* been. The concept is solid; rock just needs to see it proven once more. And I can't be the only one who gets this. Picture a hundred bands, each advancing the art form with an ambitious demo of their own! The world would then see:

**By breaking the indie culture's rules, interdependent bands will be making the most disruptive *and* most accomplished works of our time. *This* is the next revolution in rock history!**
